This is what we've been at these last months (thanks to your contributions): 

- Support and include more Ethereum clients. Current list: Geth, Erigon, Besu, Nethermind, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku and Lighthouse
- Testing and releasing an image for the Radxa Rock 5B device
- Updating the documentation and translating to Spanish
- Research and include other blockchain components in the image: IPFS, Swarm, Status, StarkNet
- Research on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Arbitrum
- RISC V: Continue to research and try to run an node on this architecture. Wouldn’t It be great to run an Ethereum node on Open Hardware?.

The current options to run a node require technical skills to open a terminal and run commands or install a new operating system. Running a node should be as simple as downloading an app.



I started NiceNode to solve this. NiceNode is an app that runs, monitors, and controls a node. 



Your contributions will fund a whole new and improved UI/UX, more node options, and a foundation for staking with validators!

NiceNode is currently available for Linux (tested on Ubuntu), Windows, and macOS and the alpha release is ready for downloading and testing. Please try out NiceNode and give feedback and suggestions! Report a problem or request a feature on NiceNode’s Github.



For now only Execution clients (Besu, Nethermind, and Geth) and Consensus Clients (Lodestar, Nimbus, Teku, Lighthouse, and Prism) are supported by NiceNode, but stay tuned as the next releases will include the ability to run Layer 2 nodes and other Ethereum ecosystem nodes, and testnet nodes!

Developing this cryptographic primitive into wallets will unlock sybil-resistant anonymous apps like zk nullifiers for anonymous unlinked airdrops, anonymous decentralized voting which only allows one vote per account, and message boards with a consistent identity. We think that fully executing this work will create a whole new class of dapps and web3 social apps with pseudonymity.



This grant will go to helping to integrate a new, non-interactive signature scheme into wallets such as Metamask, filing an EIP, and engineering the zero knowledge cryptography behind it. Note that this scheme offers an improvement to semaphore or tornado cash nullifiers, because the first few people who sign up will not have small anonymity sets. The grant will also help to publish the paper that proves the security of the scheme via a DDH-VRF argument, and pay for conference expenses so it can be presented more widely. It will be split amongst Kobi, Aayush, Richard, Piotr, and anyone else who would like to help productionize this work!



We will likely call the final version your plume -- a privately linked unique message entity. In other words, we will deploy verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum.



If you'd like to read the paper, it can be found at https://aayushg.com/thesis.pdf. The slides to fully explain the new scheme are found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mKtOI4XgKrWBEPpKFAYkRjxZsBomwhy6Cc2Ia87hAnY, and the code is here: https://github.com/zk-nullifier-sig/zk-nullifier-sig.

Setting up an Ethereum Node is technically demanding and needs a lot of research & preparation to do. Being confronted with this challenge a lot of nontechnical people therefore, even if they are in the position of owning 32 ETH, are choosing to use a staking service to not risk their funds, which in turn slowly centralises the network. 

🍄 OUR SOLUTION 

Stereum is our answer to this problem, a toolkit to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum/Gnosis Node using an intuitive GUI to abstract the installation process down to a few clicks, lessening the technical entry barrier for the average person. 

To use Stereum, you download the launcher & connect remotely to your fresh Ubuntu server.  

In three clicks, Stereum configures all necessary prerequisites your server has to meet, installs and runs Ethereum client software, and ensures that your node is properly connected and synced with the network.  

By setting up your own node  with Stereum you are able to participate in Solo Staking in your preferred network and validate transactions and blocks. The node also serves as your gateway to the network for data science, dApp usage and development.  

With Stereum you also have the opportunity to run different node related protocols (like SSV, etc.) & profit off of there unique architecture.  

Stereum, our Ethereum Node Installation, Setup & Management tool aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your node for ETH staking, data science dApp hosting & development.  

We hope to explore every hermit’s dream with you! 

🍄 USE OF FUNDS 

Your contribution is greatly appreciated by the team and will be used in various ways – development, testing and security audits. We spend the funds generated through grants and donations purely on tasks, that will benefit the progress of the project and therefore the decentralisation of Ethereum as well as protocols on it.

PROBLEM

Etherscan provides a great block explorer for web3, much like Alphabet provides a great search engine for web2 and Microsoft provides a great OS for businesses. However, core Ethereum values run counter to a closed-source, single-solution ideology for a decentralized blockchain network. Open-source alternatives are absolutely required to augment, improve, and democratize the block explorer experience. 

Ethereum-based blockchains and L2s need better open-source explorer options to support: 
-Checks and balances (is the data accurate?)
-Redundancy and resiliency (what if Etherscan is down?)
-Community-driven features and innovation (I want to improve and customize that explorer!)
-Transparency (How does it work?)
-Quick, cost-effective implementation (I don’t have much capital but I need to spin up an explorer yesterday!)

SOLUTION

Blockscout has been in production for nearly 5 years. We provide an open-source explorer used by more than 100 chains in the space, including public goods support for an Ethereum mainnet instance. 

Blockscout has been used by small chains, big chains, private chains, test chains, L2 chains and many others to quickly spin up an instance and provide transactional transparency right away for their users...AND we know that Blockscout needs to be improved to compete with and provide a viable alternative to closed-source explorers.

HOW FUNDING WILL BE USED

We’ve started working on a major overhaul called Blockscout 2.0. It aims to provide all the views, functionality and UX you expect from a premium block explorer. In addition, new features including Rollup support, an optimized API layer, DApp marketplace, and a new microservices infrastructure written in Rust are all in active development. More on the 2.0 roadmap -> https://docs.blockscout.com/about/roadmap/blockscout-2.0

Blockscout 2.0 is currently being built, and with your help we can bring it to the community much faster, with many more features, and with much greater impact. We are particularly excited about the new React UI for users and Rust microservices for developers. With this new architecture in place, our team as well as the greater developer community will be able to easily customize functionality without compromising performance.

We will also devote grant funding resources to improving rollup support. Rollup usage is growing every day, and we need to provide comprehensive views to support this ever-expanding world of layer 2 data. 

As we continue to decentralize the future, the tools and infrastructure supporting decentralization must also follow this pattern. We appreciate your funding to support a transparent, open-source, premium block explorer!

Funds raised through this grant will be used to pay people to coordinate and navigate community to better educational resources, educate community, encourage people to work and build in open source, support Ethereum Core development.



The Ethereum Magicians is a Community of Individuals collaborating on improving the Ethereum Protocol. FEM (Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians) forum provides a high signal noise free space for discussing any Ethereum Protocol Improvements, supporting the community in protocol decision making, and providing space for high quality discussions.



The Ethereum Magicians community is focused mainly around Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). We provide a key communication channel (forum) for core developers and the community to discuss anything EIP or Ethereum Improvements and Protocol related. 

We are hanging out on https://ethereum-magicians.org/ forum and sometimes in person at bigger events. 



The ongoing benefit that we bring to the community is that our work empowers decision-makers to gather feedback and move the tech forward, and encourages developers and researchers to collaborate closely via the Magicians' Forum. This helps make Ethereum the best technology that it can be!



Funds received will be managed by members of the Operations Ring, a group which manages resources for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, organises events, and maintains the Forum. Your donation will be used to organise upcoming events and discussions, operate and pay for maintaining and moderating the FEM forum and expenses related to these activities.

It provides censorship-resistant, private, and fast access to immutable data--there is no “recentralization” of chain data. 

TrueBlocks uniquely: 

- Creates an address-optimized index allowing for 18-decimal-place-accurate-reconciliation,
- Provides local-first queries, caching, and transformations without the fear of third-party snooping,
- Produces and distributes—for the public good—an “equitably” maintained and low-cost index through content-addressable storage,
- Retains the integrity of the data through a “reproducible” extraction process,
- Offers a set of technologies that can be used as building blocks for “truly” decentralized applications,
- Scales in a way natural to web3 by leveraging content-addressable storage (IPFS) to shard and cache received data.

From their desktop, users can/will be able to privately access their own historical blockchain activity. Accomplishing:

- Monitor token holdings and market values over time,
- Manage securely and view NFT holdings,
- Determine gas fees paid over time,
- View and export fully reconciled transaction histories by account/asset
- Watch for and notify about airdrops
- Track activity with other addresses
- Receive off-chain email notifications/triggers of activity on addresses (future...)
- Watch DAO activity (What proposals are pending? Must I vote on something? Who has voted for what in the past?)
- Conduct DAO-level monitoring and accounting
- Manage ENS names and expiration dates
- Programmatically and quickly filter, sort, and enhance blockchain data
- Consolidate data across accounts/addresses
- Build testing algorithms (e.g. ""digital twins"") to facilitate smart contract testing, auditing, ongoing monitoring, and simulation
- Take our highly efficient and precise indexing engine, metadata layer (time and name databases), and query functionality and add more specialized, use-case-focused, features (e.g. different UIs, data visualization, exporting options).",https://trueblocks.io,tjayrush,TrueBlocks,tjayrush,"Self funded.
