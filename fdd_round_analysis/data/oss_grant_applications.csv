It provides two basic apps for zero knowledge ( age verification, zk voting using semaphore). Since then the project has evolved to include blog and other tools for solidity and zk ecosystem. 

The goal of zk block is educate and help users to develop quality zk and web3 apps. 

With recent developments in zk-evm ecosystem, we will work to provide tools and boilerplate to work with zk-evm such polygon zk-evm and new paradigms like polybase.

We are working on a universal library that provides web3 functionalities in Swift language so that developers can build full-featured native dApps on the Mac/iOS ecosystem. 

Developers can find out-of-box functionalities that they usually need in our library, such as web3 web view kit, ABI parsing and decoding, smart contract interactions, etc. Moreover, since Swift allows compilation to WebAssembly, the library also supports WebAssembly. This allows iOS/MacOS developers to work in their native interfaces. As a result, the library greatly improves developer productivity, and helps fulfill the vision of decentralized applications.

There are several other open-source projects in the field of web3swift, such as [Web3 (0.4.1)](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift), [Web3Swift.io](https://github.com/zeriontech/Web3Swift), [web3swift.pod](https://github.com/bankex/web3swift), etc. But in terms of the technologies adopted, our library is yet the most advanced one tha„Ñô most of them, since we have full support of such features as **TxPool, ENS, event loops, etc**. Our library is therefore more widely used by the community.


We provide the community with **convenient tools** to work with Ethereum blockchain in Swift. Developers can therefore attain the ability to **quickly create secure decentralized applications** for Apple devices, without studying cryptography beforehand. This allows developers to focus on the content quality and UX/UI in DApps, which in turn **increases the adoption** of Ethereum blockchain and facilitates community growth.

The library was an essential part in several winning projects at ETHBerlin2018 and ETHDenver2019. We made it possible to work with Ethereum from mobile devices. Nowdays, our library is one of the most used iOS/MacOS libraries for Ethereum, and it was used in almost all ETH-related hackhathons.

Our project is in great demand, more than 10 dApps have been using our [codes in production](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift#projects-that-are-using-web3swift), such as [Loopring](https://github.com/Loopring/loopr-ios?files=1), [PeepETH](https://github.com/matter-labs/PeepethClient), [ENSWallet](https://github.com/barrasso/enswallet), and many others. We have [more than 1000 references](https://github.com/search?p=4&amp;q=pod+%27web3swift%27&amp;type=Code) in GitHub.

As the library is so popular, our users also keep pushing for updates. There are  [several new features requests (25 open issues for now)](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/issues). But since this is the team's open-source side project, we can&#39;t spend the money we raised with Matter Labs to support it, especially when it&#39;s unrelated to the main goal of Matter Labs: To scale Ethereum.

We already put in a vast amount of work to support the most used functionalities, including the following:

- ‚ö° Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality
- üí≠ Interaction with remote node via **JSON RPC**
- üîê Local **keystore management** (geth compatible)
- ü§ñ Smart-contract **ABI parsing**

- üï∏ **(ENS) support** - a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names
- üîÑ **Smart contracts interactions** (read/write)
- ‚õ© **Infura support** , partial Websockets API support
- ‚öí **Parsing TxPool** content into native values (ethereum addresses and transactions) - easy to get pending transactions

We will use the funds to make #aPRENDOcripto, a personal finances and crypto training program in low-income neighborhoods of Buenos Aires city.







#aPRENDOcripto: Blockchain for all

 

The program consists of 4 workshops with theoretical and practical content where the participants will learn about personal finances, blockchain technology and possible use cases, with the close supervision of mentors to facilitate the learning experience.

 



We aim to:

 

‚Ä¢ Give a brief introduction to basic personal finances so the participants can have the necessary tools to take care of their income.

 

‚Ä¢ Introduce participants to blockchain technology and the crypto ecosystem, sharing its use cases, contributing to an education for the future and helping to bridge the technology gap.

 

‚Ä¢ Create and encourage a crypto community in the neighborhoods, uniting young people with the same interests to promote collaborative learning.

 

‚Ä¢ Make the participants interact with decentralized technologies, facilitating access to the creation of a profile in Proof of Humanity, a social identity verification system for humans on Ethereum, where they will acquire a first contact with the world of cryptocurrencies by receiving the UBI token and become part of a DAO.







What we did and what we will do



With the funds we received in previous Gitcoin grants we were able to:



üöÄ Put together a team that will help us achieve the goals we have planned. Our team is made up of professionals who share a passion for blockchain technology and a socially conscious outlook. 



üöÄ Set up one edition of #aPRENDOcripto which has already been completed in May 2022 and start to deliver another one that is taking place right now (will finish on Sep. 13th) at Barrio Mugica, a low-income neighborhood of Buenos Aires. 



üöÄ We are launching the third edition of #aPRENDOcripto in Villa Lugano (Buenos Aires) that will take place in Sep. 20th.



üöÄ Paid for all Proof of Humanity profiles generated (Ethereum mainnet fees, ~0.03 ETH per participant)



Our goal is to deploy 20 more training üéì programs in a year, to do so we will need:



* 2 or more venues to make the workshops (we already have one confirmed in Villa Lugano)

* 15 mentors (volunteers)

* 6 teachers (volunteers)

* 18k USD on operative costs (900 USD per edition)

* 8k USD to onboard 400 participants to Proof of Humanity (Ethereum mainnet fees on 2022, and Gnosis fees on 2023)

* 42k USD to cover annual headcount expenses

Our goal is to provide the fundamental infrastructure of Web3 social by introducing the first comment widget that can be deployed on any Web3 website with permanent data storage, so that users can speak up for themselves in a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant environment. It is our conviction that every person deserves to be heard, and we strive to create the right tool to make that happen. ‚ÄúLong live our opinion‚Äù, as our slogan goes.

More importantly, as we are providing a multi-chain, multi-platform, and multi-disciplinary solution, ECHO will energize the social mobility in an aggregated manner to address the current social segregation issue in Web3. And our protocol-based data structure of social activities both on-chain and off-chain will be the cornerstone of the future Web3 social paradigm.

Our opinion is our intellectual assets. People don‚Äôt own their voice in Web2, and people have no tool to own their voice in Web3. People are awakening that decentralization should not be limited to finance, but also in other fields. And we need a product so that people can speak freely and equally without worrying about censorship and privacy issue. And Arweave is a much better storage solution than IPFS that the technology is mature to make this happen. 

ECHO provides a neutral commenting tool that can be used to comment on anything, including Gitcoin grants.

We have established partnerships with companies and products such as Arweave, .bit, everPay, Mirror, Mail3.me and permaFacts.

Institutions, DAOs and Web3 projects, all encounter the same problem: How not to accept ""dirty"" money on their Smart Contract without killing usability with a tedious KYC process?

SOLUTION üí°
Integrating KYD Oracle into your Smart Contract allows it not to accept transactions from blacklisted addresses by your chosen set of rules, i.e. addresses that have ever interacted with Tornado Cash or those flagged by forensic companies üîé
How's that possible? Every time a wallet wants to send a transaction via your protocol RedStone KYD Oracle attaches to that transaction's call-data a note if a given address should be allowed to interact with the Smart Contract or if this transaction should be refused. Hence, the UX stays the same and you are protected against known malicious actors üòé 
KYD Oracle is available on all EVM-compatible L1s & L2s.
Check out the Twitter thread explaining how that tool could facilitate entrance of institutions into DeFi üëá

We are building a decentralized Video Streaming Platform Maven House .

Maven House is redefining physical and virtual experiences by providing a platform for vloggers, influencers, musicans, creators, artists and creators to create, manage, host physical and live-stream events where they can connect with their fans globally.

This gives artists complete control over their performance and monetization while also removing barriers for the audience. Platform is able to handle traffic for an event of any size, from anywhere in the world.

DEMO LINK : https://mavenhouse.io/

The Problem with existing Video Streaming Platforms

‚Ä¢ Current Video Streaming Platforms are owned by Centralized Organizations like YouTube, Facebook(Meta), Twitch, etc. and the creators itself has no ownership of their content.
‚Ä¢ It is difficult for streamers to make any earnings out of their content as these platforms levy 50%+ commissions from the user's revenue also the user himself has no option to earn royalties from his content.

Commission rates of centralized video streaming platforms.

‚Ä¢ Twitch - 50% of subscription fees & 29% from Donations.
‚Ä¢ YouTube - ~45%
‚Ä¢ Facebook - ~30%

The Solution

The value of content should be decided by the audience & not by the platform. The incentivized platform for all users with multiple inbuilt streaming features.

‚Ä¢ One Window that does it all
Maven House has all essential features like YouTube Chat, Video Preview, video editor, recent events, stream labels, and dashboard in one app so you can save your monitor real estate and CPU usage for something else.
‚Ä¢ NFt Ticketing for Physical & Virtual Events
Creators can sell, host and schedule live or physical events with their fans and sell tickets in the form of NFTs.
‚Ä¢ Memberships NFTs Or SuperFan 
The content creator can set up customized plans through his dashboard for their die-hard fans.
‚Ä¢ Creators NFTs from Livestreams
Creators can create and can sell their streaming-video clips as an NFT with their fans.

Tech Stack

‚Ä¢ Polygon for on-chain storage and NFTs minting.
‚Ä¢ Livepeer for decentralized video streaming
‚Ä¢ IPFS for file and metadata storage
‚Ä¢ XMPT for chatting.
‚Ä¢ Unlock Protocol for Membership and Ticket
‚Ä¢ Next.js as a frontend framework
‚Ä¢ TailwindCSS for design

Loanshark is an aggregation and automation platform created for DeFi borrowers.



Our Motivation:
We identified a few key issues with the current state of DeFi.
- High operational burden to constantly monitor yields and health factor especially if users have multiple positions
- Low capital efficiency from a lot of manual operations
- Poor UX from a lack of support for tools like automation/notification bots


Our Solution:
Loanshark offers the following features:
- Automated position management toolbox that allows users to create workflows that span multiple protocols (e.g. Set up a workflow that automatically withdraws funds from farms and then repay your debt based on health factor and/or interest rates)
- Simple and protocol agnostic interface for borrowers to originate loans
- Aggregated liquidity across different lending platforms to offer the lowest rates


Demo video:

Optinames are tradable and transferable sub-domains wrapped as ERC721s & fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on L1 Ethereum by utilizing an off-chain resolver.

What We Do:

This project is leading the charge in making it easier & cheaper to acquire and utilize ens domains. We are implementing the latest technologies released by the ENS team (CCIP Read & Off-chain resolution) to make it possible for users to register subdomains on Optimism while making them available & resolvable on L1 Ethereum.

In addition to providing free ENS subdomain on Optimism (currently ecc.eth), OptiNames is partnering with NFT projects & gaming communities building their games on any Layer 2. These communities will be utilizing our tech and smart contracts to provide free usernames & gamer-tags that double up as ENS subdomains.

Adoption:

The first project utilizing Optinames to issue subdomains to their community is ECC Name Service. ECC Name Service has since grown to become the Number 1 domain collection on Optimism.

Registrations: 17,725

What Next?: Optinames is working on and will soon be launching ENS Wildcards on L2

Many NFT communities on Ethereum and L2s have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, requiring each NFT holder to manually register an ENS subdomain can be cumbersome. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names.

Wildcard subdomains offer a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder to receive an ENS name automatically at no cost & without any registration step. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (linked to an NFTs token ID) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection.

working on a more user-friendly gaming environment.
Dark Forest is an MMO strategy game built with zkSNARKs on Ethereum and xDAI. We had full fun playing Dark Forest, but at the same time, we have some ideas and plans to improve the game using zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology.



We have many ongoing programs:



Game experience optimization, timely release of user-friendly plugins according to the latest game rule changes.



We recently release DF ARTEMIS, which is a Planet-targeted bounty mercenary system.

Funders can publish tasks to planets, mercenaries can attack those planets and get rewards.

DF ARTEMIS provides a new game mechanics to Dark Forest, which can bring fun to both new and old players.

Besides, DF ARTEMIS can be a DAO governance tool, which efficiently distribute tasks and corresponding incentives.



the open source code: https://github.com/dfarchon/df-artemis

We released DF GAIA , which is a user-friendly dark forest plugin development library.

the open source code: https://github.com/dfarchon/DF-GAIA

If you have any functionality you want the plugin to implement, please feel free to send email to df_archon@hotmail.com.





Acceleration of ‚Äúmove‚Äù operations: According to our in-depth analysis of on-chain data, the fastest player in Dark Forest can currently perform 8 on-chain operations in one minute, which is unimaginably slow in the traditional game experience. We can leverage some of underlying technologies of the blockchain to accelerate operations, including but not limited to the modification of the zero-knowledge proof scheme and the parallelization of the on-chain transaction.



Game Strategy Evaluation Sandbox: Empowers advanced players to evaluate the excellence of their game strategies in a more quantitative way, including but not limited to fine-grained real-time data analysis, simulated opponent matchups against specific strategies, video replay analysis of past games, and more.





Who are we? 



DfArchon is a newly established gaming group focused on Dark Forest, with three members currently. Our members are all blockchain developers, dedicated players of Dark Forest, and also have art design skills. 



We are working on game strategy development, experience optimization from blockchain layer to client-side game, sandbox platform for game strategy evaluation, etc. More ecological projects are waiting to be discovered. 



The DfArchon team has received a lot of help from the official Dark Forest Discord server, the Dark Forest Chinese community (especially the wechat group organized by keke.eth) and MarrowDAO during the process of getting to know the Dark Forest game.

When we say that an Ethereum account has been lost, it refers to two cases:

The owner forgets the private key, which means the assets are permanently lost.
The owner leaks the private key, which means anyone with the private key can act the same as the original account owner.
Our project aims to protect account owners of the latter case, which is very dangerous: the account owner loses the exclusive right to use the account, which indicates the account is not secure anymore.

For leaked accounts, DApps should be aware of them on time to protect the original owners of these accounts. For example, when one reports that her account is leaked:

Multi-signature wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe) should ban this account.
Web3 email providers (e.g., MetaMail) in which users log in with signatures should suspend everybody's access to emails of this account to protect the privacy of the original owner.
Electronic agreements based on ETH accounts (e.g., ETHSign) should disqualify this account from signing new agreements. Because the new agreements signed may not be authorized by the original owner.
To solve the above problems, we propose the 0xdeadlist.io project to maintain a list of addresses whose private keys have been leaked. By rewarding the burier NFT (Non-fungible token), 0xDeadList encourages users and hackers to report accounts with leaked private keys, and stores the information of these leaked accounts on the chain to facilitate DApps project parties to query these insecure accounts.

What it does
0xDeadList is a public good that encourages users to collect and report addresses whose private keys are leaked. Users can directly log in to 0xdeadlist.io to report the leaked address. The main contract of 0xDeadList provides two steps (lock address and bury address) to report leaked addresses under the following considerations:

Preventing the reporter's NFT reward from being stolen by front-running attacks.
Ensuring the reporter has enough time before the private key of the leaked address is fully disclosed.
In step 1, the reporter locks the address to be buried, and the contract records the address of the reporter. At this time, the private key of the locked address will not be disclosed.

In step 2, the user uploads the private key of the locked address in step 1, and the reporter address recorded in the contract will receive an NFT reward, indicating that the address is buried, and the buried (or say, leaked) address will receive a tombstone SBT (Soul Bound Token), which is not transferable. In step 2, the private key of the buried address will be made public (recorded on-chain), ensuring the leaked address is indeed leaked.

Codeslaw is a meme of the ""code is law"" & ""work in public"" web3 virtues, integrated with the 'code deference' legal philosophy pioneered by LeXpunK army and refined by LexDAO contributors. 

If we think of Solidity ""smart contracts"" as codeslaw initially invented by legal engineer Nick Szabo, then it's apparent that codeslaw is one of the most important forms of OSS in web3. 

Codeslaw is for the 'unlawed' what Proof of Work is for the 'unbanked' https://distributed-autonomous-society.quora.com/The-Unlawed . 

Most of our members are cryptolawyers and legal engineers, but that's not a requirement. All codeslaw fans are welcome!

As a DAO, we fund a variety of internal & external projects that span the multidisciplinary requirements of codeslaw public goods & services. 

LexDAO does a lot of codeslaw pro bono work, ensuring the funds we have get the job done regardless. Sometimes codeslaw is more important than money!

All donations to this Gitcoin Round will be used by our DAO to directly pay for OSS codeslaw development. Additionally, we always prioritize positive impact DAO and projects that offer valuable practical-web3-experience student education opportunities.

Jolocom has been supporting and driving the mission of Self-sovereign Identity since 2014. We are a founding member of DWeb, INATBA, Bundesblock and also long-time supporters and active members of DIF, the IIW and W3C. We joined the Gitcoin-Community in early 2022, together with our friends from DWeb and the Internet Archive. 

 

Jolocom is committed to upholding the principles of SSI and has developed a fully open-source tech stack to that end, consisting of a library, an SDK and Smart Wallet for end users. During the infancy of digital identity, this has brought us to the forefront of development houses in Germany and Europe and also to the attention of regulators and lawmakers. Among other things, we are the chosen tech providers in three quarters of the German government‚Äôs Secure Digital Identity showcase projects.

Now, though, we are seeing the mature phase of digital identity approaching: by end of 2023, every EU citizen will be asked to hold an ""identity wallet."" But will that identity be Self-Sovereign? In other words, will citizens and users finally be in control of their own identity data or will it be under the control of a monopolistic centralized authorities or oligopolistic federated actors?

 

For Jolocom to continue building open source, not-for-profit SSI solutions, as we have for the last eight years, and to further establish EU and global standards for interoperability in decentralized identity, we need to scale at the same speed as the growing market. And here we need your help. 

 

In the aforementioned Secure Digital Identity (SDI) Projects of the German government we are building out the Jolocom SmartWallet to integrate different government services, bridge between different services and industry actors via the Jolocom Issuer and Verifier Agent, while also partnering with researchers and experts to prepare a UI/UX design ready for mass adoption.

---
Vocdoni's vision [1] is to improve democratic health and promote participatory governance using decentralized and open-source technology. To achieve that, we are building the Vocdoni Protocol, a censorship-resistant, secure, anonymous and transparent voting protocol to facilitate decision-making for communities and organizations regardless of whether they are digital natives or traditional organizations.

For implementing the voting protocol, Vocdoni developed the Vochain [2], a public voting blockchain, as well as a set of tools that facilitate its usage such as an API [3], an SDK [4] and a dApp. Today, this technology serves numerous organizations around the world by providing them with a secure, transparent, easy-to-use and low-cost voting system.

The main initiatives for the 2023 Roadmap are:
1. Voting-as-a-service: Commoditize voting
2. Enhanced Web3 protocol: Anonymous gasless voting with verifiable onchain execution
3. Increase decentralization: Migrating to Proof-of-Stake blockchain

Time is running out. Climate research today needs to focus immediately on practical solutions. We need research that leads to mass movements and exponentially growing impact. Like the US Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E), the Climate Research bundle will be a key engine of climate innovation and climate action. While fixing our sights on the high bar set by ARPA-E is wildly ambitious, we know that blockchain technology can exponentially increase effective and efficient scientific research. Integrated indicators make the research replicable and scalable and allow improved documentation and verification. The ambitious and innovative projects in the Climate Research bundle will architect many systems of the new infrastructure of climate research and scientific collaboration. 

This bundle is comprised of 8 critical and interrelated projects address various challenges of climate research by generating:

‚ö° Clean, cheap, abundant, and reliable sources of energy and the need to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on cities and urban areas.

üí® Increased speed and efficiency of traditional methods for conducting and translating scientific research

ü§Ø Solutions to the complex set of root causes that contribute to the long time it takes for scientific research to be implemented in real life

üîç Increased transparency, traceability, and access to funding for scientific research

ü¶æ Effective mechanisms to protect intellectual property, reduced investor risk in, and increased investor access to the scientific and technological innovation process

ü§ë Profitable ways for companies to align with community values related to climate change

üî¨ More effective research, and strategies for promoting and supporting scientific innovation that positively impacts the world and its inhabitants

üå± Developing regenerative data tech, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage

The projects contributing to this effort are:

üåé SCINET
üåé Option
üåé ScienceFund
üåé Internet of Animals
üåé Defi Biolabs

FrontierDAO @FrontierDAO;  Collectively incubating scientific and engineering innovations and innovators, using Web3 tooling (linktr.ee/frontierdao).

One of our key focus areas is ‚Äúfusion energy as a climate solution.‚Äù Fusion energy, while still in its infancy, is the technology that will usher in a new era on this planet - one where cheap, clean, abundant, baseload energy is available for all. 

Nuclear fusion energy is the energy of the stars and sun. It is the opposite of nuclear fission.. 

To help usher in this new era of transition to clean energy, FrontierDAO has released in BETA an IP NFT on-chain scientific publishing platform called FrontierRegistry. By publishing research on the blockchain, we aim to foster greater collaboration while protecting authors‚Äô IP rights. frontierda.xyz/faqs-projects

Funds raised from GR15 were used to partially underwrite a 12-week Fusion Energy As A Climate Solution weekly workshop series that ran from November to mid-January. Interviews can be found on Youtube.com/@frontierdao.                           

SCINET, INC @scinet_inc. At SCINET, we are increasing the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of life sciences research from ‚Äúlab to life‚Äù by developing a suite of software applications in a decentralized (""DeSci"") life sciences ecosystem that addresses the complex set of root causes for why it takes 17 years for life sciences research, including climate solutions, to get into real life (see here for socials, media mentions, website, etc.).

We help scientists conduct and translate research faster, more accurately, and more efficiently by offering them a unique confluence of decentralized funding, blockchain-protected IP, unique trust mechanisms, and commercialization strategies that reduce investor risk, increase scientific innovation, protect intellectual property, and positively impact the world and its inhabitants.

Option, @option_hq: Option is a prediction market for governance that incentivizes companies to align with community values, including those related to climate change, by making it profitable for them to do so. An example of climate governance using Option could be creating a market where players can make predictions about a company's carbon emissions reduction targets. If the company meets its targets, those who predicted accurately would be rewarded. This would incentivize the company to align with community values and reduce its carbon emissions in order to profit from the market. Furthermore, the funding provided by the market could be used to support research and journalism focused on climate change and carbon emissions reduction.

Science Fund, @sciencefund_io: Fund basic science with donations recorded for posterity on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Science Fund is empowering scientists to freely, openly, and rapidly pursue their best scientific ideas. To achieve this, we are reimagining how discovery is funded. No grant applications. Transparent, traceable funding records. Rapid funding cycles that support more ideas early and continue funding what‚Äôs working. In this Gitcoin Round, we plan to test some of the mechanisms we thought out. At least 80% of the funds collected in this round will go towards our first Climate Action funding pool, the ‚ÄúUrban Climate Impact Mitigation Pool‚Äù. 

Specifically we will support ‚ÄúUPP‚Äù - the ‚ÄúUrban Planting Project‚Äù incubated at the AKASHA Hub in Barcelona. UPPs mission is to turn every available city space into green islands of chill. By easing heat stress, UPP is helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote new sources for local food production in cities. UPP has already formed partnerships with local universities and communities to deploy its ‚ÄúUPP toolbox‚Äù and will apply S.M.A.R.T. principles to quantify the project's impact both through technology including real-time tracking, and satellite imagery as well as by documenting the social impact of their project.

Donors to our Gitcoin grant will be recorded in the funding pool through their Ethereum addresses and will receive certificates of the impact that allows them to unlock information and data about the project‚Äôs success at regular intervals in the future. 

Internet of Animals, @WildlifeMovemnt: Our mission is to create a community of scientists that promotes the design, development, implementation, and improvement of accessibility to software, hardware, and knowledge resources related to wildlife movement ecology. To realize that vision, we formed The Wildlife Movement Institute, a nonprofit organization to be a hub for this community for local, regional, and international collaborations ‚Äì whether you are an expert or someone passionate about wildlife and technology. Since the end of GR15 we have established a bank account, set up a business account on CoinBase and are now preparing to invest in web development and getting 501(c)(3) tax status. 

Defi Biolabs, @Defibiolabs: Bioengineering algae to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
GR15 Grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7497/defi-biolabs-is-engineering-cyanobacteria-to-prod

Circonomy, @CirconomyDAO: Recycle & Reuse 2 Earn 2 put the ‚Äúeco‚Äù in ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù (https://www.circon.me). 

We aspire to become a DAO platform to proliferate circular economic projects all over the world. We'll accomplish this by building a dapp which will have a combination of on-chain registration of hardware-based circular economic projects such as Precious Plastic. This will be crowdfunded to ensure common ownership and stakeholdership. This will be supported by on-chain tracking of all recycling activity which will have a recycle-2-eajjrn cryptoeconomics model underpinning it.

We are currently creating a crypto-back solution for the world of recycling & reusing. We‚Äôll accomplish this by tokenizing existing points-based recycling/reuse-2-earn programs administered by not-for-profit organizations such as Circulr.ca and RedeemClothingRecycling.com. This allows us to better empower end users with an interoperable incentive that would have a unified reward pool amongst all of our partners as well as grant more autonomy to our partners to scale their operations.

The high-level summary of our tokenomics is as follows - there will be a dual-token system whereby:
The token users will earn will be created by coalitions between brands and nonprofits so what we mean by this is - depending on the material in question and/or other factors, we‚Äôll have coalitions of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that will mint a utility token together for earning. As an example - ideally, all clothing-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that handle clothing recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable fashion brands. Likewise, all plastic-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that deal with plastic recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable toy/merch companies. In that latter example, there may be multiple coalitions given that the toy industry is a specific/niche market. But regardless, we‚Äôre starting with the fashion industry as our MVP.

This utility token will not be tradable in the exchanges because Circonomy itself will have a token that will be liquid in the exchanges out there. This token will be token-bonded to the utility tokens within Circonomy‚Äôs ecosystem and thus in order for users to either obtain other utility tokens or liquidate them, they‚Äôll have to exchange their utility token for the Circonomy token. Each utility token will be exchangeable for rewards such as discounts or exclusive access to brand events that are token-gated or NFT phygital goods. But if they don‚Äôt care about those things, they may simply liquidate by way of exchanging for the Circonomy token and then selling their Circonomy token, or they may stake the Circonomy token for gains of course and helping to drive value.

Grow Your Own Cloud, @_GYOC: develops regenerative data technology, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage. 

It works! We‚Äôve just been awarded the science breakthrough of the year from Falling Walls for our functional prototype 'Data Garden'. We‚Äôve also just finished an EU-funded research project that demonstrates how urban scale implementations of GYOC could absorb megatonnes of carbon and store terabytes of data.

Now we‚Äôre developing a unique Web3 offering we call ""Non-Fungible Plants"" (NFPs). NFPs are physical plants with data encoded within their DNA. Data like JPEGs and MP3s. They‚Äôre the first truly plant-based NFTs ever created. They‚Äôre the first step to build data systems that work in harmony with living systems for maximum positive impact.

To enable our vision, within Web3 we are forming GYOC DAO: an internet-native organization dedicated to accelerating the transition to truly green data storage. Funds raised through this bundle will help the continued growth of an organization which more closely resembles a public good than a traditional tech company. Together we can create a future where server farms could be replaced by data forests.

We believe DAOs can provide a path forward where knowledge is decentralized and talent is unlocked for the betterment of society. 
 
There‚Äôs just one problem: The science of DAOs is yet to be known; it must be explored. It must be learned. Traditional scientific settings are largely broken due to outdated institutional norms, obsolete academic infrastructure, and inefficient funding models. So without hesitation, a team of researchers has taken the plunge down the Web3 rabbit hole to find a new solution. 
 Our focus is on building coordination software for the future of work, conducting applied research experiments with DAOs, and perpetuating decentralized work culture through art, media, education, and events.

At talentDAO we are studying layer zero and building human coordination experiments so that we might all benefit. In simplest terms, we are using science to fix DAOs and DAOs to fix science. To do this well will only be possible if science is given an infrastructure and culture upgrade. This is where we come in. 

Zooming out

 

DAOs create opportunities for global impact. Human coordination structures of this scale have never been available to solve challenges in scientific innovation until now. Over the next 20 years entire communities of scientists will organize using DAO structures. A digital nation of scientists operating as a DAO will dramatically improve the probability of achieving important sustainability goals mandated by the United Nations. We focus on four of them. 

 

Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Everyone should have access to decentralized working arrangements. To see that through, we‚Äôre building the foundations required for a decentralized work economy starting with the talentDAO community. Our goal is to have the majority of members who wish to be bankless and self-sovereign workers a reality by 2030. Everyone should have the right to decent work, free from affliction and labor exploitation.
 

Goal 9: Build infrastructure and foster innovation

The traditional academic process has stifled innovation. The scientific record of knowledge is vulnerable to the risks of centralized Web2 storage. TalentDAO is building all of its research on a completely decentralized publication that is censorship resistant, immutable, and safely secured on Arweave. We are fostering innovation by allowing for a bottom up approach to research by creating an open social graph of scientists built on Lens Protocol. 
 

 

 

Goal 10: Reduce Inequality

Ensuring funding and educational resources are provided to all students across the world, not just the weird ones. Contributing to open source research that is accessible to all and with no paywall required. Traditional research publications systematically discriminate against students with less access to education resources. 
 

Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities

 

In the future DAOs will be sovereign digital nations. At talentDAO, we aspire to create a Network State of interdisciplinary educational institutes, providing high quality education and research to all parts of the world, not just the privileged. We cannot go at this alone. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve teamed up with groups such as CityDAO and Sapien Network to scale together.


What we are building

 

Web3 solutions for scientific peer review, funding, and publication. Making it easy for any education program to launch a journal and sub-DAO.

 

Our first solution is a framework for a peer reviewed journal publication and open science social graph with native DAO governance on-chain integrated. We are building research primitives and governance technologies to help onboard the next 1000 web3 enabled research sub-DAOs.  

How we educate and advocate

 

Products take time but our mission can‚Äôt wait. That‚Äôs why we began creating original applied research from day one. Several emergent research projects have formed that are entirely driven by community participation and championed by a talentDAO researcher. We do our best to provide resources to these groups and onboard more students to help create new ones.

1. DAO Leadership: Sharing leadership is a key tenet of DAOs. Yet distributing leadership across members of a community is easier said than done: there are several instances of centralized leadership within the web3 ecosystem. For this reason we set out to study leadership in the decentralized world of work.

Our researchers are the heart of talentDAO, and in 2022 we saw the Research Guild come to life.

We are proud to share with you a list of 8 projects that we‚Äôve been working on with our different community-operated teams. This is a summary of our milestones and things we will be working on during 2023, which promises to be an exciting year for the Research Guild. 


1) Network health survey
In decentralized organizations, we have the opportunity to analyze more data than ever before. Governance processes and other on-chain activity is made publicly available thanks to the blockchain and off-chain communication data is accessible through various API services. For example, both Discord and Discourse offer public APIs for data extraction.

But communication and on-chain activity still do not tell the complete picture of what is happening under the hood. We must also extract data on the psychosocial properties of the organization in order to have a complete understanding of the health of a DAO. To do so, our team has designed a survey that will collect the data necessary to understand the health of organizations so DAO leaders can take action to improve the experience of contributors. Learn more about our process of designing this survey and the theoretical discussion here.

We will be launching a series of organizational assessment pilot studies in 2023 with DAOs who want to use science-backed tooling to assess their community health. Survey participants will have access to a non-transferable proof of completion NFT made claimable at the end of the survey which will unlock access to future perks and drops. Survey participants will also have the option to opt into our data-sharing program and earn a share of transaction fees generated from our Data NFTs minted on Ocean Marketplace.

2) Project L.I.O.N.
L.I.O.N: Language Informatics on Organizational Networks

Project LION is a joint DAO effort from talentDAO and LabDAO to build natural language processing systems for analyzing and maintaining community health.

For DAOs specifically, transaction data can provide insight into on-chain governance operations and degrees of decentralization. However, many DAO operations occur off-chain in the form of relational data. And there is a particular piece of information that is both deeply insightful and stored off-chain: communication.

This is a software project that will build a tool that will allow us to do research. It is in the development stage and the team is raising funds on Gitcoin. Be sure to check out their grant page if you are as excited about this project as we are. The project roadmap write-up can be found here.

3) Decentralized Leadership
‚ÄúDAOs don‚Äôt have hierarchies‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a boss‚Äù ‚ÄúDaos are leaderless‚Äù

-Is that so?

At talentDAO, we believe that leadership emerges naturally in any human organization. DAOs are no exception to this, so we decided to study how leadership works in a decentralized space. We began with an extensive literature review on organizational leadership where we covered the last 25+ years of academic research.

Then we moved on to interview leaders from all over the world who work in different DAOs. We talked with more than 20 founders, core members, contributors with long experience in the space, and mentors. All that information is currently being qualitatively analyzed by our team, and we will present the results at ETHDenver and in a future publication.

Expect early research results to be communicated in January 2023. A series of educational workshops, leadership coaching tools, and training seminars will be designed based on the findings of our research on Decentralized Leadership.

4) Onboarding
One of the main pain points that DAOs suffer is trying to get a smooth onboarding experience that allows them to get and retain new members. Our team is working on a multi-phase study that aims to know more about the different strategies that the DAO ecosystem has to onboard new people, so we can identify best practices and strategies that suit the different kinds of DAOs. During 2022 the team focused on a literature review to examine existing frameworks to evaluate onboarding experiences (or induction processes, as traditional organizations call them). After that, those frameworks were adapted to the requirements of DAOs and now are ready to be tested in 2023.

In the coming months, phase 1 will be launched with the recruitment of mystery shoppers that will join different DAOs to experience their onboarding process. We will then evaluate this through ethnographic observations and surveys made with the frameworks we discovered through the literature review. Review more of the project deliverables on the team‚Äôs Notion page. 

5) DAOversity
This study is a collaboration with BanklessDAO where we made a survey asking questions about inclusivity and underrepresented groups, so we could know if members felt comfortable in their space. This is a qualitative confidential study and we managed to collect more than 150 surveys. Right now we are preparing to analyze these responses so we can share the results with the broader community. We are eager to discuss these results to keep debating about people feeling included in DAOs and how we can improve their experiences.

6) Discourse Knowledge Graph
So many DAO communities rely on Discourse to host their online forum discussions. These forum discussions are often focused on topics related to changes in the DAO‚Äôs protocol or improvements in governance. For a data scientist, the Discourse knowledge base is a treasure trove of data. So why not study it to understand the meta-science of DAO governance? This study seeks to do just that. 

While the study is in its infancy it has quickly garnered interest within the talentDAO research community. Several data scientists have quickly volunteered to develop a proof of concept of a sensing tool that uses NLP to analyze topics.

Check out the research proposal cross-posted on the Smart Contract Research Forum to learn more about future directions: research forum post

For the DAO hackers out there the data notebook has been made public to explore the NLP models being used.

7) Compensation
At talentDAO, we conducted a survey investigating the relationship between different compensation structures and contributors‚Äô attitudes like motivation, satisfaction, commitment, and fairness perceptions. Using an experimental vignette study we wanted to understand if certain DAO compensation strategies resulted in more favorable perceptions of organizational justice. The four incentive strategies studied were bounties, Coordinape, hourly payment, and salary. Not surprisingly, salary was viewed as the fairest payment method. Study participants vocalized pay stability as an important factor when determining if they perceived a work environment as fair. Very interestingly, as the DAO community size grew bounty systems were progressively viewed as less favorable. We believe these findings will help inform future DAO compensation design in the tooling space.

This project was a joint effort with BanklessDAO where we collected 166 respondents. Read more about the full study here: DAO Compensation study

In 2023 the team aims to do more analysis of this data and then present a written document to share with the community. We also plan to have several open working sessions and webinars related to DAO compensation.

8) DAO Structure & Design study
The core objective of the DAO Structure & Design project is to create a well-researched body of knowledge about DAO structures and design. It is not an audit project about what exists, but more about how effective and impactful DAO structures should look like. This body of knowledge will be published so the broader community can discuss the results and make use of these insights.

Right now the team is finishing the literature review so they can move on to do structure analysis and interviews with DAO cartographers (those who map the organizational chart of the DAO) in Q1 2023. After that, the project will move on to Stage 2 to do in-depth interviews with builders, community managers, and experts in the DAO ecosystem to ask about organizational structures in web3 and to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt from their perspective.

Highlights:
There is not a single person on any kind of contract in JediSwap. Everything is done by the community and 300+ contributors.

JediSwap is one of the first protocols to receive a grant from Starkware. JediSwap is all time #1 project on Gitcoin Grant from the funders count.

Argent-x(biggest wallet on StarkNet) integrated JediSwap to power swap functionality.


What is JediSwap?
JediSwap is a fully composable and permissionless AMM that enables users to swap assets and earn yields on their assets instantly with almost 0 gas fees. Builders can build more advanced applications on top of JediSwap without asking anyone's permission. JediSwap is completely open source for anyone else to use in any way they want.

JediSwap is built on StarkNet - a Validity Rollup on Ethereum enabling unlimited scalability to web3 while relying on the security of Ethereum.


JediSwap is an entirely community-driven project. Independent open-source contributors do everything, including development, design, and marketing. Anyone can come and start contributing by joining JediSwap Discord.



Who is behind it?
The Mesh Finance community is leading the development of JediSwap, which has been building in DeFi for the last 24 months. Mesh has been deploying and experimenting with multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and almost all top DeFi protocols.

Mesh community is bottom-up; anyone can start contributing and become a leader as they contribute. There is no power concentration. Mesh has developed a system to measure all kinds of contributions, including development, design, community management, growth, etc. Compared to most DAOs, Mesh is not just decentralizing governance but enabling operations and execution in a community-driven way.



What is different?
The Mesh community believes that billions of people will come to crypto-only if it is cheap, secure, and easy to use.

Cheap - JediSwap will be one of the 1st gasless dapp on StarkNet.

Secure - Thanks to StarkNet, JediSwap leverages the security of Ethereum. Users never rely on multisig bridges to leverage a cheaper and scalable ecosystem.

Simplicity - JediSwap believes in simplicity both for users and builders. Users can swap or earn by adding liquidity in one single click. By keeping the simplicity rule on the smart contracts level, JediSwap also enables devs to build many different kinds of applications, which was impossible on L1s before. There are already 25+ teams building on top of JediSwap. These applications include creating on-chain games, metaverse projects, cross-chain apps, aggregators, and furucombo style dapps.

Community - There is not a single employee at JediSwap, and everything is done by the community.



Why Validity Rollups (aka ZKRollups) and StarkNet?
The next wave of crypto will come for various non-financial applications like gaming. As a result, there will be a 100x number of tokens launching on scalable L2s instead of L1s. These users will prefer the cheapest tx and the most uncomplicated applications that are easy to understand and use. The Mesh community believes StarkNet is a front-runner in the Validity Rollup (also known as ZKRollup) ecosystem. The mesh community has been building on StarkNet since October 2021 and has seen a 20x increase in the number of builders building on StarkNet.



What else is special?
While building JediSwap, the Mesh community is publishing many public goods. Some of the published public goods include

StarkNet React library - it saves hours of work for any builder building a frontend app on StarkNet

Base64 encoding in Cairo - a primitive which can make generative art possible on Starknet

DeFi Pooling(coming soon) - Enabling access to L1 apps by batching txs on StarkNet

DAO tools and frameworks: 
- Ability to give Discord/Twitter contributors tokens/NFTs while preserving the privacy
- An alert bot for Discord communities and contributors to make coordination easy



Roadmap:
Current:
Mainnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet mainnet on 30th Nov 2022, and 10000+ users have used JediSwap since then.

Testnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet testnet on Jan 2022 and 150,000+ user have used the JediSwap on testnet since then.

Next 3 months:
Integrations - focus on building integrations with 50+ dapps
Launch DeFi Pooling as a public good
Onchain contributor profile
Productionize DAO tools to make them usable by any community

-Wordblock extension

You can clip any text from any website, add tags, comments, and save the location (URL) as metadata.

You can write block-based memos, add tags and extra information(e.g. the real location: üìçüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è38W,4S). For example, when you pick up a book in an antique bookstore, and you want to ""steal"" some words from it before you take it home.

The text is generated under the user's own DID signature, while data is stored on a distributed content storage network--IPFS to enable public search.

- Wordblock.xyz - a global text block search engine

All the word blocks created will be pooled in one place for public search, or later public reference.

For example, you can process public block searches via tags, keywords, or user DID

Compared with local storage note-taking tools like obsidian or central storage Roamresearch, the difference is in data storage in order to achieve public block search.

- Use cases

1) A social graph
After collecting those text blocks, it is easy to form P2P social relations*(e.g. walletChat)* via tag matching.

2) A decentralized multi-lingual literature library
The inspiration is when I visited an ancient Malatestiana library (the 1st public library in human history) in Cesena, Italy.

Each codex is tied to the desk with a root ironed chain, so that precise objects could not be stolen, it is now a symbol of the arts of literature, copies include 20 years italian, french and german s copy by using humane scripture called ""literature antiqua"", text includes classical latin authors, churchenergy , greek‚Ä¶

It's like a warm salute from afar history that tells how humans keep words and knowledge. In the context of today, we stand a chance to ""chain text"" differently and interestingly with technology.

Today, we care less about ""preventing books from being stolen"" but about ""HOW things are connected"", so the desire to build a distributed literature dictionary(library) where people from anywhere in the world could contribute their input even in different languages.

For example, after I read the Chinese version of„ÄäMr.Gywn„Äã, I para-read the original Italian version, then build the connections in between. It is one of the very fun techniques for acquiring a second language through intertextuality, while also a way to let the machine know how people from different linguistic computing systems tell the SAME story.

3) A data graph
we are in the early stage of defining data as an asset with maturing infrastructure like IPFS, Ceramic network, dataverseOS etc, the excitement of web3 is the data as streams that can be visualized and later used by individuals. We could first collect those fragmented attentions üëÄ with ease, and then browse/ the data, or re-organize(reference) with personal signature.

- Tech

1) Ceramic Streams
Wordblock uses Ceramic Stream to store the JSON metadata of a block. Metadata includes BlockID, Creation Date, Source URL, Author, Tags, Type, and Content. The DID of the user submitting the block to the Ceramic network is also bound to the metadata. The Wordblock data model can be shared between anplications on the Ceramic network.

2) web3.storage
Wordblock uses web3.storage for data backup and permanent storage. Our backend API can get all the blocks created by the given user DID to implement a global search on the wordblock.xyz page.

Every ENS user can receive a notification if it happened to their name. 


The problem

Names in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it. 

This type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:
- Substitution of character pairs i/I, i/j, O/0, w/vv, m/rn, etc., which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;
- Replacing ASCII characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, ‚Äúfa—Åeboo—Åk.eth‚Äù uses the letters o and —Å from Cyrillic;
- Use of invisible Unicode symbols; 
- Spoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth. 

ENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.


The solution

Develop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering "".eth"" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.

Forta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.

In addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash. 

As a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.

We deliver a free weekly newsletter breaking down complex topics, cutting through the noise, and delivering summarized crypto news for our users to stay up-to-date. 

3. Surge Passport NFT
With the mission of onboarding women into the Web3 industry, we launched the Surge Passport NFT: a golden ticket into the crypto space, offering opportunities, early access, and discounts to token-holders through a one-time purchase.

Sold out in less than a week, the Surge Passport is a collection of 5,000 hand-drawn NFTs generated through our custom-built generative art algorithm. Since launch, we have built a community of over 2.5K unique owners who have claimed thousands of dollars in value through their Surge Passport NFT.

Additionally, because we experienced the difficulties of building and launching an NFT project ourselves, we have spent the last year publishing resources to making the process a lot friendlier. We have created articles describing NFT smart contract development, how to build generative art algorithms, how to market in the web3 space, how to build community, among others.

4. A Web3 Infrastructure Course
After researching our community, we realized many are craving a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology works under the hood. That is why we created the ‚ÄúWeb3 Stack - Crypto Infrastructure Behind the Scenes‚Äù course. 

This course is specially designed for people working in non-technical Web3 roles, as well as Web2 engineers looking to understand the Web3 infrastructure deeper to make the leap. Students walk away with a firm grasp of blockchain technology so they can excel in their Web3 career. 

5. Surge Jobs Board
Our Web3 Jobs Board pairs 250+ vetted female talent with some of the industry‚Äôs top organizations looking to diversify their teams. This is a key part of our vision in securing women‚Äôs place within Web3, as we provide organizations with hiring opportunities directly from the talent we‚Äôre seeing rise in our community.

6. A vibrant and supportive Discord community
Connecting women and non-binary individuals in real-time, our 8k+ Discord community is filled with newcomers and experts who support one another through our crypto learning journey. Strategically built to be a friendly, welcoming and inclusive environment, this is the digital home for the Surge community to run initiatives, share insights, and collaborate synchronously.

The Future of Surge
We‚Äôre laser-focused on bringing more community initiatives to life and providing even more value to those who have trusted us with this mission.

Alongside our many initiatives - like ecosystem research, Twitter Spaces, articles, investments, and community projects - we will now be heavily invested in developing open-source educational content for individuals and organizations to learn and scale up their Web3 capabilities. We invite anyone who shares our mission, including our male allies, to join us in making this possible.

Providing free, easy-to-understand educational content is a huge challenge to solve, but we are confident that with the right resources and like-minded individuals, there‚Äôs a lot more we can do to solve this imbalance!

**Support us and help us secure women's place in Web3. Your donations will be used to pay our contributors, purchase tooling, and continue to fund our educational, research, and community initiatives.**

Resources are scattered across blog posts and GitHub libraries. This results in a high barrier to entry, thereby slowing the widespread adoption of zk-SNARKs and associated privacy-enhancing technologies. Even worse, implementing zk-SNARKs without understanding the fundamentals of how they work increases the potential for security issues.

We want to change that with our MoonMath Manual to zk-SNARKs, designed for an audience with only minimal experience in cryptography and programming.

What is particularly unique about the MoonMath Manual is that it is designed to enable users to construct zk-SNARKs using simple pen-and-paper computations. Throughout the manual, users are encouraged to complete exercises that ensure they engage with the foundational building blocks of zk-SNARKs. While doing that, readers build the smallest possible ‚Äî but fully functional ‚Äî cryptographic stack to compute zk-SNARK internals without the need of a computer.

The most popular service among attackers of DeFi projects was the Tornado Cash mixer. However, after it was blocked by The US Department of Treasury, other projects will likely take over this niche. Aztec Protocol, which is a privacy-first zk-rollup on Ethereum, could be a potential such project. 

Project goal

To improve attack detection in the Forta Protocol ecosystem, develop two separate bots  to cover both the account funding stage before an attack and the money laundering stage that occurs after the attack is performed.

Funded Account Interaction Bot

This bot detects when an account that was funded by Aztec Connect interacts with a contract.

The severity of these findings is low, as they do not indicate malicious activity. However, in the presence of other suspicious activity, they greatly increase the accuracy of attack detection.

Money Laundering Bot

This bot detects when numerous large transfers are made to Aztec Connect, potentially indicating post-hacking money laundering activity. All user transfers are summed up within a specified time and checked for exceeding the threshold. The severity of such findings is high.

These bots will work similarly to existing bots for Tornado Cash, and I'm sure they will be able to increase the accuracy as well as the number of detected attacks.

  Early investors buy new cryptocurrencies at the lowest price. In this way, they finance the first steps of the team, their promotion and entry into the cryptocurrency market. However, it is worth noting that not every team manages to go through all the stages of project formation and success. Possible technical and organizational moments that happen or become impossible for the further development of the project. Nevertheless, early investors still purchase tokens for new projects.



  Participation in tokenseals has become quite popular in recent years. This is due to the fact that consumers expect to sell the acquired crypto-assets worthy of attention after they are released on exchanges. This is one of the options for getting ""X's"" in cryptocurrency.



  The tokenomics of a cryptoproject should be studied before deciding to invest in a particular project. It can help determine how balanced the current economic model is, and understand if the investment data will be profitable. In addition to this, there are several other things to consider:

Experienced investors always carefully and thoroughly disclose the tokenomics of a project before investing.
In order to avoid early sale of project tokens by early investors, the project's tokenomics includes a blocking token to classify contagion cases.
Each consumption category has its own token unlocking schedule (vesting), which gives when and in what state an investor receives tokens and sells them.
For development, the token unlocking schedule helps predict token selling pressure and find reasonable entry points into the project (when token unlocking is due, selling pressure, which causes the token price to drop).


The project was created with full enthusiasm. We want our site to benefit the crypto community. We need your support to further develop and improve the service, Thank you!

Forta is a decentralized monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time.

Underlying Forta is a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.



## What is this agent

After the sanction of Tornado Cash, many attackers move to other services to launder their money. Umbra Protocol is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum, meaning it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh address, which is controlled by the intended receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that. Although technically speaking Umbra Protocol is not a mixer, its privacy protection feature makes it seem to be an alternative to Tornado Cash. Consequently, this agent will be built to monitor transfers related to Umbra Protocol, and hopefully, we can link the sender and receiver accurately based on its working principle.",https://github.com/Soptq/forta-bot-umbra,Soptq,,realsoptq,Donations and grants,1,Yes,https://github.com/Soptq,2023-01-12 04:20:35,2023-01-12 04:20:35

If there was a system of voting contracts covering a wide range of possible voting types from token-weighted voting via quadratic voting to delegation, then DAOs could simply plug in rather than hard-coding yet another, say, token-weighted voting into their contracts. Plugging in would be as simple as pointing to a deployed voting contract. One can also plug out or exchange the reference from one voting contract to another.

We have deployed a registry contract to polygon and mainnet (https://etherscan.io/address/0xC535389b5a26efEbc27811915B6d78f6C95433f7) and opened a topic on the Ethereum magicians forum to discuss the EIP draft: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-draft-configurable-voting-contract/10736 

I am currently developing a dapp that lets people interact with a playground, where one can plug in and out of voting contracts and get a feeling for the framework. This site is hosted on ipfs and served through ens: https://votingcontracts.eth.limo/. The development of this app and the deployment of the underlying playground and pluggable voting contracts to ethereum mainnet are the next steps. Feedback is very welcome. Please do reach out with feature requests and ideas. There is also a node package: @leomarlo/voting-registry-contracts, though I am considering migrating that at some point.

----About Umbra----

As a protocol, Umbra defines a simple set of standards, coupled with a singleton smart contract instance, to enable stealth addresses on Ethereum. With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is. 

On chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they‚Äôve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.

By leveraging meta-transactions Umbra enables withdrawers to pay relayers for gas using the tokens they‚Äôve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing.

----Project Status----

The Umbra MVP went live in June 2021. You can visit https://app.umbra.cash to send and receive stealth payments using Umbra.

Since our launch, we've made many iterative improvements based on user feedback. These included better mobile responsiveness, a simpler key registry system, faster scanning when searching for received funds, and other UX enhancements. We've also launched Umbra on Polygon, Optimism, and Umbra, and made huge improvements to our relay system to make token withdrawals faster and cheaper.

Since launch, Umbra has processed nearly 100,000 payments across all networks,  transacting more than $50 Million in value in the process. More than 52,000 accounts have registered stealth keys to enable privacy preserving payments through Umbra. Despite this growth, Umbra remains a grant funded public good project made possible by the community.

---- What's Next----

We are grateful to our many supporters who have enabled us to get this far. There's still lot's more work to do!

We believe there is so much more we can do to make Umbra an even more powerful privacy tool in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the year ahead, we're focused on continuing to improve Umbra through withdrawal integrations, new network deployments, performance improvements, and host of small UX improvements and features. We're also working with researchers to develop a Stealth Address EIP, so that Umbra can remain an open, public goods protocol.",https://app.umbra.cash,apbendi,ScopeLift,umbracash,Grants,6,Yes,"https://github.com/apbendi, https://github.com/ScopeLift",2023-01-12 18:59:11,2023-01-12 18:59:11

But starksheet is not a block explorer.

As you can expect from a spreadsheet, you can use the result of one cell in the definition of another.

Orgassign is a contribution platform and all-in-one workspace that makes it easy for remote teams to work together, taking some of the best parts of Discord, Github and Notion while ironing out many of the major pain points.



Most DAO contributors today have to keep up with Discord + Notion + Google Docs + Github in order to figure out what they should be working on. Orgassign designed an all-in-one tool that fixed these pain points. It doesn‚Äôt bombard you with notifications like Discord, its token-gated permissions are simpler than both Notion and Google Docs, and unlike Github, it‚Äôs also designed for non-technical contributors. ‚Äç



Orgassign helps contributors increase their efficiency by tracking tasks and goals while also providing a lasting, single point-of-reference so everyone knows what‚Äôs being worked on(and why). It manages to do all this with a tidy,intuitive interface.



Orgassign is a shared contribution space with different sections:



Roadmap - with goals, projects and tasks showing how everything fits together. Contributors are able to see a clear line between the organization‚Äôs overall goal, their team‚Äôs efforts, and their individual assignments.


Wiki - is where important information that has more permanence lives. Notes can be added to the wiki using hashtags as you are working on projects, so knowledge management is not a separate task but part of the workflow.


Groups and roles - manages what individuals can see and contribute to, which can be done through token-gating.


conclusion


Ultimately, Orgassign is designed to help you work in quite a specific way, making sure plans and tasks add up into an overarching vision(OKR style), and integrating documentation with task management. This is well-suited for DAOs because it retains historical knowledge that would otherwise be lost if individual contributors moved on, a common occurrence in the space.

-
Geo Web is a set of open protocols & fair property rights for anchoring digital media to physical locations.

It creates decentralized consensus for an augmented, shared reality layer covering Earth guided by public good values rather than corporate profits. 

The Geo Web will bring digital media, gaming, data, commerce, and NFTs into the physical world as shared experiences rather than siloed applications. 
-
Why the Geo Web?
 -
Large portions of our lives are shaped by our smart devices. This will only compound with the adoption of augmented reality smart glasses and other always-on wearables/embeddables. The foundations of our lived reality shouldn‚Äôt be defined by arbitrary app store rules and the subversive, never-ending drive for corporate profit growth.

We‚Äôre building the Geo Web because we think the metaverse should be based on permissionless, public internet infrastructure. It should be an extension of the ethos/design of the internet, the early web, and Ethereum.

The Geo Web is divided into digital land parcel NFTs which map 1:1 to the physical world. The market for digital land is administered under a partial common ownership (aka Harberger tax) system. Digital content can be anchored to the land utilizing our p2p content layer (Ceramic, IPFS, & Filecoin).

The Geo Web is a fair, efficient, and legitimate way to bootstrap and scale the metaverse across our shared planet. 

By reinvesting 100% of land market proceeds into rewarding open-source developers, creatives, advocates, users, and public goods, we can create compounding network utility and value. The Geo Web is a choice for positive-sum coordination over fixed-mindset tradition.

If the Geo Web is successful, we can help spur the adoption of partial common ownership systems beyond our network and help redefine global property rights systems to be fairer and more efficient.

Update Since GR15
- 
The Geo Web launched on Optimism with a fair launch auction on December 15th, 2022! You can claim a parcel at your home, business, or favorite public place now at https://geoweb.land/.  

This project has been a labor of love for over two years. We couldn't be more excited to be live and thankful for the support of all the Gitcoin contributors that empowered us to make it here.

Plans for Alpha Round Funding
-
With the Geo Web platform/economic system live, the core team is shifting focus to building and supporting use cases with partners, builders, and creators. 

Funds received from this QF round will primarily be distributed to core team members and open source contributors through Coordinape Circles and/or Govrn's DAO contributor platform as we maintain that use case focus.  We may allocate some of the funds to bounties on Dework and incidental costs of development/tooling/hosting use cases as well.

These funds will help bridge the core team until the Geo Web digital land market produces enough revenue to fund its own QF rounds (https://docs.geoweb.network/community-and-governance/network-funds-allocation).

Participants will work through a series of abstract expressionist art exercises focused on increasing their sense of unique and individual identity, boundaries, and self-esteem.  
Readings or discussions paired with the exercises and either in-person or online support, will give participants opportunities to practice and gain a deeper understanding of the rights they have as a person to make their own decisions, to try new things, to learn new and valuable skills, to increase the confidence they have in themselves, to process trauma, to heal, and to bring beauty into the world.  
It is our intention to create an open sourced web3 platform (dApp) to enable these workshops, the creation of NFT representations of the physical art they will be creating and to introduce the participants to the world of web3 in general. From de-fi to privacy protection, web3 is a place where workshop participants can find the tools they need to further practice self-sovereignty, self-determination and self-efficacy.
There are domestic violence resources to leave. There are escape plans.  There are advocates who will guide you through the court process.  These resources are stretched thin as paper and require call after call to access them.  You know who can‚Äôt make call after call and get return calls?  Women who are living under the thumb of a domestic terrorist.   
Getting away is a mother fucker.  It is dangerous.  It is TERRIFYING.   I know because I‚Äôve done it.  
My ex-husband tried to kill me by pushing me down a flight of stairs to a concrete floor in front of our 4 year old son.  
My daughter‚Äôs father, a different man, dragged me out of bed by my hair, broke my finger, choked me, and squeezed my jaw so hard that I could barely open my mouth for 4 days.  While I was pregnant. When I finally got him out of my house and had a restraining order, I woke up to him standing over me as I slept after breaking into my house.  He was not arrested, despite the restraining order.
Therapeutic art  has been one of the most powerful tools in our recovery.
There are countless recovery programs for abusers that are paid for by the government and usually court mandated.  There are endless free (and paid) recovery/rehab programs for addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, and eating disorders.  There are many 12-step meetings daily, all across the US for these issues.   
For people who have experienced abuse, recovery programs are few, not well structured, and underfunded.  You often find people with good intentions running a circle of stories centered around the abuser (codependent behavior) that often turns into the suffering Olympics, rather than focusing on the woman, her progress, and her well-being.  
To be clear - abusers are 100% responsible for the abuse they dole out.  There is no BLAME to the person who is abused.  
That being said, getting and staying in an abusive relationship is the result of not having a clear sense of self and strong boundaries.  The red flags that typically occur long before abusers take things physical would end the relationship for people with healthy boundaries.  The problem with never having had any agency over yourself is that you don‚Äôt understand that LEAVING is the correct response to abusive behavior or that you even have that as an option.  While ending the relationship and respecting yourself are exactly the right answer, no person alive can do those things if they don‚Äôt know, really know, deep down, that they CAN and that they have an intrinsic power over their own life.  If you were raised, like I was, with zero autonomy, you simply have no idea about personal boundaries, let alone how they apply to you, and that someone that will hurt you will never just change their mind and stop hurting you.  
There is a glaring lack of help that teaches people how to move forward and into an identity away and apart from the negative pattern of abuse that is likely all they have ever known, either to work their way up to getting out of an abusive situation or to rebuild themselves after they have left.
This is the space we aim to fill.

They will ultimately end up with a history of their process from start to finish, a story of their healing.

Future Goals:
Additional curriculum material from a diverse group of artists - ongoing
Gain widespread adoption of the curriculum for use by domestic violence services and individuals nationwide
Create a variation of the curriculum to be used with kids as a DETERRENT to domestic violence
Broaden the potential use to people who speak a wide range of languages beyond English
Additional goals will be added as they become clearer

Founder Personal History
I have been painting since 1995.  I am a self-taught artist, gathering information and skills from a few college classes, a handful of online classes, YouTube tutorials, extensive reading and art evaluation, and just DOING it.  Painting has been many things to me, but what is most relevant to this is that it has been therapy and life.  I believe that art in all its forms is one of the most powerful means of personal transformation and restoration that exists.  While my current art practice is primarily about bringing beauty and joy into a world that can be very harsh, I have used art to process grief, to build my sense of self, and to exorcise traumatic events and their memories.
I started in oils and worked sporadically in that, aerosol,  and other mediums as a means of self- expression until 2010.  At that time, I began to use art to process trauma, specifically domestic violence and rape.  The art therapy techniques my son was taught at age 4,  after witnessing his father try to kill me, were essential to his recovery, and led me down this path.  I began working in acrylics/mixed media and found a magic I had previously only known through making music.  I have also worked in watercolors, primarily in 2011 and again in 2019, when we were in Morocco, during which time I created an entire body of work - 30+ pieces - over a 5 month period, and solidified my desire to move toward being a full-time artist.  
In the curriculum we are outlining, the most important thing is developing a sense of self and the absolute value of each individual‚Äôs perspective, expression, taste, and message, all of which happens in the inner world..  Neil Gaiman said ‚ÄúThe one thing that you have that nobody else has is you.  Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision.‚Äù  In my opinion, sparking the imagination of the inner world of an individual and repeatedly affirming the value of their voice is one of the most revolutionary things you can do, especially for someone who is being, or has been oppressed.  What happens inside of us belongs only to us. 
In my opinion, abstract and emotional expressionist art are a deeply impactful form of visual communication that allows both creator and viewer to be moved in profound ways. My degree is in Mass Communication and Journalism with a minor in Psychology which deeply informs my understanding of visual communication.  I have studied brain and behavior correlation and taken a deep dive into PTSD, trauma, and recovery from it. 
My current work is an exploration of vibrant color, texture, shape, movement, and telling stories by imbuing the canvas with energy and emotion.
The largest history and all of my past and current work can be viewed on my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/iMaakeArt
I am an expert in connecting seemingly divergent groups of people through art and music with a proven track record..  My career as a financial planner speaks to my ability to communicate complex ideas in an easily understandable way, to manage numerous relationships simultaneously, to network broadly, and to steward resources responsibly.  I am accustomed to floating between groups of vastly differing socio-economic and cultural situations with consideration for all and an eye to my own internalized biases.  I have taken several courses in Group Therapy and believe what I learned about group dynamics will be an asset.
Currently I am the owner of Sunshine Alchemists & Soap Co and Night Sun Candle Company in addition to being an artist.  We employ women coming out of domestic violence and give them flexibility and support to maintain financial solvency while continuing to be present for their children.   Receiving funding for this project will enable me to shift further into community healing and art and free up finances to hire more people at the shop.  
 I have lived a great deal of life, which has given me a tremendous amount of compassion.  My parents were Christian fundamentalist pastors with a church and school in Montana. Our family lived in the abandoned forest service building that also housed the church and school.  We showered at the Y across the street.  There was no real kitchen.  Our power was turned off regularly.  I know what it is to live out of a gym bag and rely on the kindness of others for food. I had my first job at 12, out of necessity, touching up frames in a factory. Thankfully, my path also led me to live in the Bay area, New York, here in New Mexico, and to spend time in New Orleans and Miami, with people from all over the world. 
 I learned that how I was raised and what I thought was normal was far from it and that unlearning is an intentional process which is ongoing.  I have lived through‚Ä¶ way too many violent incidents of varying natures, and as Lin-Manuel Miranda says, ‚ÄúWrote my way out.‚Äù 
Co-founder Personal History
As a woman who has had a long career in tech I‚Äôm excited to be involved with a project that I feel will have a significant impact on bringing more DEI to the space. More importantly, it will have an impact on reducing the suffering caused by domestic violence and hopefully reduce the numbers by ending what can sometimes be generational patterns. 
I started my career more than 20 years ago when I graduated with a degree in computer science. Since then I have worked as a full-stack developer, architect, consultant, engineering lead at a successful startup and founder. I have the skills necessary to help bring organization and coordination to this project to ensure the funding received is used as efficiently as possible and to guide development on the web3 platform in a way that will see real results. 
I‚Äôve been involved in the web3 space since 2018, currently work for a web3 protocol, belong to many DAOs including several with a focus on DEI and serve on the board of advisors for multiple web3 companies.   
DEI Round
You can find the statistics in our grant or on Google but it is widely known that historically disenfranchised groups of people, women, children, BIPOC and LGBTQA+ communities with fewer resources  are disproportionately affected by domestic violence. That is the community we will be serving with this program and that is the community we will be helping onboard to web3, thereby increasing diversity in the space. Additionally the current team, although small, is all female.

**Problem Statement**

As DAOs scale to larger number of contributors, it is naturally becoming harder and harder to maintain a shared sense of context among all contributors. This has led to the formation of sub-DAOs and guilds. However, most of the current tooling to manage grants, bounties and tasks, distribute rewards and make decisions are built for monolithic DAOs instead of modular ones. Moreover, these tools are point solution which means each tool serves a specific purpose. Therefore, with every addition of a new tool for a new use case, there is a loss of context among contributors.

**About Spect**

At Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to form circles (or sub-DAOs) that manage grants, bounties and tasks. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build history of contributions with soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials.

**What can Spect be used for today?**

1. Forming organizations that can scale N levels deep
2. Run Ecosystem Grants Program
3. Run Onboarding Program
4. Run Surveys
5. Manage Tasks and Contacts as a community

Here are docs on how these can be implemented in an organization -
https://docs.spect.network/

**Features**

1. Fully customizable tables, kanbans, lists and gantts which can be used to setup workflows
3. Web3 enabled, sybil protected forms with ability to analyze and export responses
3. Extensive Automations to automate chores
4. Credentialing using soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials
5. Payment on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and Avalanche with any token using personal wallets or gnosis multi-sigs.

**Integrations**

1. Discord to map roles and automatically assign roles, send messages and create channels using automations.
2. Guild.xyz to map roles and give granular permissions
3. Gitcoin Passport for creating sybil protected forms
4. Mintkudos to distribute soulbound tokens to contributors
5. Snapshot to run voting periods on form responses and other data

**What is upcoming?**

1. Templated Use cases - Organizations will be able to setup advanced workflows within seconds with templates
2. Complete Composability - Spect will be made composable on various different levels. Both developers and non-developers will be able to build their own applications with Spect. We already have an early version of our API docs that developers can use. In the near future, tables, lists, boards and forms will be made embeddable such that non-developers can build their own experiences using these.
3. Make it possible for anyone to build custom widgets and bots on Spect.

**How we will use the funding?**

The funding will be used to pay for infrastructure costs and contributor salaries.

He also collaborates closely with the Dark Forest team and other 0xPARC-adjacent projects.

Blaine is a developer who is excited about web tech, open source, the future of decentralized virtual worlds, and ZK applications. He got hooked during the first public round of Dark Forest and has been building in the ZK application ecosystem ever since.  Some of his work includes:

** ZK Tooling and hardhat-circom **

In collaboration with Jacob Rosenthal, Blaine helped to rewrite Dark Forest's zkSNARK build processes. This work was generalized into the hardhat-circom plugin, a configurable hardhat plugin which provides developers with a set of ZK circuit build tasks, and provides TypeScript declarations for snarkjs.

** Contributions to circom & snarkjs **

Blaine contributes to circom and snarkjs on a regular basis. He‚Äôs provided patches to reduce the bundle build by 50% and enabled WebWorker support.

** Hardhat plugins **

Blaine created and maintains a series of hardhat plugins, such as hardhat-diamond-abi and hardhat-settings, which make large-scale projects easier to manage. All of these plugins were made possible through funding raised on Gitcoin and will continue to be maintained as long as they are useful to people!

** Project Sophon **

As one half of Project Sophon, Blaine open sources many experiments related to Dark Forest or other ZK ecosystem projects, such as darkforest-local, Broadcast market, and DF plugin-dev-server.

This prevents a small group from gaining too much control. 

Idena offers a puppet-resistant crypto-identity primitive, which is used for democratic voting, Quadratic Funding, fair airdrops and decentralized governance.

Idena is accessible to anyone. It does not require any personal information and allows participants to join the network without any investments. Users play an active role in mutual verification by challenging each other with AI-resistant FLIP-tests. This process is done in a synchronous ceremony, which ensures that individuals cannot spoof multiple accounts.

The network is protected from Sybil attacks through regular validations and Quadratic Staking.

We're live. You can try Spect here.
https://circles.spect.network/

**Problem Statement**

It is hard to operate a DAO successfully without the right processes & tools in place. For example, 
1. A grant program could lead to a high number of churn among grantees if grantees are not supported well or are not provided with enough companionship to help them succeed. 
2. Onboarding new members to a DAO may lead to a cultural & experiential decay for existing members if the right members are not onboarded and if new members are not educated about the culture & processes within the DAO. 
3. It is hard to have a shared sense of context among contributors if context is spread across various platforms and resources. 
4. Incentivized surveys, more often than not, attract sybil attackers looking to make a quick buck and in the process destroying the integrity of the survey.

Spect exists to solve such problems & in the process help DAOs succeed.


**About Spect**

At Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to manage grants, onboarding and projects all on Spect and make decisions about grant applications & who to onboard in a decentralized way. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build history of contributions with soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials.


**What can Spect be used for today?**

1. Ecosystem Grants Program
2. Onboarding Program
3. Surveys
4. Task and Contact management
5. Forming workstreams that help in scaling an organization

Here are docs on how these can be implemented in an organization -
https://docs.spect.network/


**Features**

1. Fully customizable tables, kanbans, lists and gantts which can be used to setup workflows
3. Web3 enabled, sybil protected forms with ability to analyze and export responses
3. Extensive Automations to automate recurring chores
4. Credentialing using soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials
5. Payment on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and Avalanche with any token using personal wallets or gnosis multi-sigs.
6. Templates that help you get started with an advanced workflow in seconds.


**Integrations**

1. Discord to map roles and automatically assign roles, send messages and create channels using automations.
2. Guild.xyz to map roles and give granular permissions
3. Gitcoin Passport for creating sybil protected forms
4. Mintkudos to distribute soulbound tokens to contributors
5. Snapshot to run voting periods on form responses and other data
6. Gnosis Safe to distribute payments from multi-sig


**What is upcoming?**

1. Complete Composability - Spect will be made composable on various different levels. Both developers and non-developers will be able to build their own applications with Spect. We already have an early version of our API docs that developers can use. In the near future, tables, lists, boards and forms will be made embeddable such that non-developers can build their own experiences using these.
2. Make it possible for anyone to build custom widgets and bots on Spect.


**How we will use the funding?**

The funding will be used to pay for infrastructure costs and contributor salaries. 


**What can you do?**

1. Fill up the early adopter form and claim a soulbound token.

BanklessDAO is a decentralised community coordinating and propagating bankless media, culture, and education. BanklessDAO launched on May 4, 2021, and its goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truly bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.
Together, the BanklessDAO community collaborates to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralised financial technologies through education, media and culture.
The BanklessDAO community runs a variety of projects; for the scope of this grant we are focusing on the ones which truly provide goods and services for the entire world such as BANKLESS ACADEMY, BANKLESS AFRICA, and INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES. 
The projects listed below have had contributors working on them for many months and although some of the project contributors earn governance tokens, the work being done far outstrips the existing remuneration. Second, and perhaps more important, is that all these projects aim to help the wider crypto ecosystem and not just the Bankless community ‚Äî and hence are public goods.
BANKLESS ACADEMY
üöÄ Brief
Bankless Academy is a leading web3 ""knowledge on-ramp"" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.
We're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to go Bankless.
üî• Vision
We are building a web3 world where:
üìö Information is frictionless and free.
üëä Communities are high impact creators.
üåê Education is permissionless (no central body dictates what you can/can't see).
üó∫Ô∏è Trajectory
Current focuses:
Establish a Bankless-native syllabus/user journey to move users from Centralised Exchanges to Ethereum Layer2 self-custody.
Pursue collaboration with popular dApps to educate users on trusted tools available to them.
Build theory lessons with expert guests from the Bankless 'Hall of Fame'.
Form frontier partnerships so that the Academy dApp continues to support interoperability and cutting-edge use cases.
Continue research, development, and onboarding for our whitelabel platform to scale our efforts into other web3 ecosystems.
Build a framework for contributor content creation to empower talented community educators.
üìÄ Try the dApp:

üåè Let's scale permissionless education together!
BANKLESS AFRICA
Our community is focused on promoting the bDAO mission. We leverage crypto-based creations like Bitcoin, Defi, NFTs etc. to tackle problems faced by Africans.
Achievement/Growth:
*Our podcast highlights projects and people making impact in the African crypto/Web3 ecosystem.
*Our Newsletter provides well curated information on Bitcoin, DeFi, crypto regulations, projects and Web3 funding in the crypto/Web3 space in Africa.
*Our website helps Africans access educational courses. It includes a link to Bankless Academy where lots of Web3 courses are available. Eventually this website will become a native-educational platform for Africans.
Website v1 here: https://banklessafrica.com/
*We onboard and train contributors with various Web3 ethos, teaching them how to contribute in various DAOs and potentially bootstrap project ideas they have.
Some links to get into our community: https://linktr.ee/banklessafrica.
üåè INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES (IMN)
Only 5% of the world‚Äôs population are native English speakers and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80% by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, the Metaverse and Web3. All links: https://www.banklessimn.xyz/
The International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them/opening the door for them to onboard to Web3 is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want Web3 to be any different from Web2.
The story so far‚Ä¶
In Q1 2022, the total audience grew by 52% as compared to the previous quarter and our total reach is over 40,000 audience members in over 20 languages. We have more than 100 active contributors speaking 20 different languages from all parts of the world. We have worked with prominent DAOs in Web3 such as Polygon, Tribe and Yearn.
Over the next months and years, as we continue to produce content we will also start developing local language communities which will develop Web3 talent in local languages as well as organising events in different geographical locations to onboard more people.

Our Ask to the Crypto Community ...
At the highest level, the Web3 education provided by BanklessDAO stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.
We seriously can‚Äôt wait to show you what we have to offer this space.
Let‚Äôs Impact Together!
BanklessDAO believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world, both in learning and translation. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone.

Datalatte aims at transforming market research towards ethical practices with a focus on the ownership and privacy of data. This leads to bridging the economic gap by enabling people to monetize their digital footprint on a secure and fair decentralized application. Currently, traditional apps often harvest user data and sell it to other companies without the user's knowledge or consent, and users receive no compensation for their data. This has led to the rise of large corporations that hold a monopoly on data and influence our daily lives. At the same time, researchers and small and medium-sized companies struggle to obtain data to build predictive models for various purposes, such as finding jobs, providing healthcare, and educating children.

Since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, internet users have the right to access their personal data on each platform. However, many people are unaware of this right and the value of their data. Datalatte aims to address this issue by leveraging decentralized technologies such as cryptocurrency, decentralized applications, and exchanges to empower people to gain control over their data and its use.

To achieve data democracy, Datalatte plans to store tokenized data in users' wallets using protocols like IPFS and Filecoin for decentralized storage and Ocean protocol's Data NFTs for compliant and self-sovereign data licensing and monetization. However, the current table-structured data model is not easily understandable and requires significant resources to extract insights. Datalatte aims to address this issue by using a graph-structured data model based on small Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which allow for easy access and utilization of data through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and offer higher computational efficiency through privacy-preserving data pipelines.

The goals of Datalatte include empowering internet users to monetize their data, providing data scientists with access to affordable data, enabling full control and ownership of personal data for internet users, and creating a data-backed income through personal data monetization. To achieve these objectives, Datalatte will develop a decentralized data store that allows users to sell their data rather than having it sold by large corporations.

Overall, Datalatte aims to create a more equitable and transparent system for data monetization by empowering individuals and providing researchers and small businesses with access to valuable data.",https://datalatte.com,amirmabhout,datalatte-ai,datalatte_,OceanDAO & Gitcoin Gtants,8,Yes,https://github.com/datalatte-ai   https://github.com/amirmabhout,2023-01-13 08:44:23,2023-01-13 08:44:23

Our team achieves success through impact litigation, policy analysis and education, grassroots activism, technology development, and support from the public. EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.

COMMUNITY ADVOCACY

From the early days of the web, EFF understood that we must protect access to technology in order to advance freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used its fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies. EFF‚Äôs work in the growing movement for web decentralization and the public interest internet is no different.

In order to combat the ever-consolidating power of corporate giants (and end the gatekeeping, surveillance, and censorship that often accompany them), many have looked toward blockchain-based technology and cryptocurrency for remedies. EFF is optimistic about the ability of digital currency to support independent community projects, route around financial censorship, and support independent journalists around the world.

While there are still many problems to solve in the blockchain ecosystem, the world needs thoughtful, user-focused advocates like EFF to help uncover the opportunities for public good. This is why EFF fought a poorly-defined cryptocurrency provision in the Biden Administration‚Äôs infrastructure bill that could create onerous requirements affecting user privacy, and EFF also introduced bright-line rules that Congress should adopt when developing cryptocurrency regulations; we‚Äôve written extensively about the ways financial intermediaries censor legal speech; we submitted comments to FinCEN opposing the agency‚Äôs proposal for new privacy-invasive regulations of cryptocurrency transactions; and we‚Äôve called for blockchain intermediaries to issue transparency reports and protect the rights of their users. During the Tornado Cash controversy, EFF spoke out for the speech protections on software code and represented Johns Hopkins Professor Matthew Green, who made a fork of the code and posted the replica so it would be available for study. EFF also reached out to The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to seek more clarity on their interpretation of the sanctions listing. 

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS

While EFF is proud to be a leading voice in online rights debates, we also develop gratis and open source tools to enhance everyone‚Äôs freedom online. Your donations provide critical  support for EFF‚Äôs wide-ranging work, which includes projects such as:

- Atlas of Surveillance: This project launched in collaboration with hundreds of EFF members and university students. With over 10,000 data points and counting, the Atlas is the largest searchable database of U.S. law enforcement‚Äôs surveillance technologies.

- Certbot: This software tool allows you to automatically deploy Let's Encrypt certificates to enable HTTPS on your website. EFF even helped develop Let‚Äôs Encrypt which has in turn enabled free and easy encryption across the web!

- Cover Your Tracks: This successor to EFF‚Äôs Panopticlick demonstrates how well your browser and add-ons protect you from tracking and fingerprinting.

- HTTPS Everywhere: This tool automatically connects users to the encrypted version of many major sites. Just over a decade after its launch, EFF declared success and announced the planned deprecation of our HTTPS Everywhere plugin because the functionality had been incorporated into all of the major web browsers, making it unnecessary.

- Privacy Badger: With millions of active installs, this browser add-on was the first to specifically focus on blocking tracking in advertisements, instead of just the ads themselves. EFF‚Äôs open-source technology has also inspired other widely used privacy tools, including the Brave browser and Safari‚Äôs tracker blocking.

The world relies on the internet to stay connected and informed more than ever before, and that gives you a pivotal opportunity to stand up for technology users everywhere.

WHAT IS COMMONS STACK?

Commons Stack started as a think-tank primarily focused on crypto-economic primitives to underpin a design framework for a Commons, a tokenized community with a mission benefitting a public good. We aspired to scale commons as a way to realign incentives with public goods. To achieve this, we needed to elaborate cultural designs that reinforce commoning principles and create novel tools such as the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), Conviction Voting (CV) and the Praise reward and reputation system. 

Our Commons design patterns are made up of a suite of cultural frameworks and a curated library of tools for governance, funding, proposal, analytics and initialization of a Commons. Some have come straight out of our research collaborations -  such as the ABC, CV and Praise. We also use Collaborative Economics, a methodology for enabling the community to collectively propose iterate and finalize the parameters of their Commons‚Äô economy.

We see the work of Elinor Ostrom as our North Star and set out to weave her principles of governing commons into the cultural fabric of a Commons. Our Cultural Build defines practices for clear boundaries, conflict resolution, monitoring, participatory decision-making, and others principles. 

Other things we have done are supporting BlockScience in open-sourcing cadCAD, developing the edutainment program Commons Simulator, launching the Trusted Seed, developing a collaborative economics method, deploying the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) - the first field test for our Commons design patterns, launching the Commons Prize and doing a discovery of the needs of Grassroots Economics, the winner of the prize.

While we have already had some success, we have only just begun. Our research continues. The lessons learned from a first field test, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our curated commons library of tools and processes continues to evolve. 

We did not get this far alone. We have collaborated with BlockScience, Blossom Labs, Metagov, Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Giveth, 1Hive, Aragon, Token Engineering Academy, Token Engineering Commons, and many others.

Much of our Github activity (https://github.com/commons-stack) is collaborative. We work hand in hand with General Magic, Token Engineering Commons and Praise, specifically:

PLANS FOR ALPHA ROUND FUNDING

For this round, we will focus on one deliverable - donations to this grant will contribute to the costs of open-sourcing our Commons deployment protocols. Our intention in doing so is to allow any community to deploy its own commons-inspired economy, i.e, the intentionally ground-up launch of an economy to support a purpose or public good.

We are in process of building the guidelines for initializing and deploying a Commons. Funding will enable our team to continue our work on the open-source documentation of our deployment protocols that will help Commons facilitate the communal management of public goods through a regenerative economic system. 

The documentation covers the four phases of the Commons deployment: Engage, Incubate, Hatch and Launch. In every phase, we outline the processes, tools and different concepts that will bring about the creation of a sustainable and scalable Commons.

 
UPDATES SINCE GR15
 
Donations from the Gitcoin GR15 helped our team accomplish the following in the last quarter:
 
- We worked with our pilot Commons to grant over $400,000 to various Token Engineering initiatives, via the economic system we collectively designed.

- The Token Engineering Commons has proved out the value of the Augmented Bonding Curve and Trusted Seed approach, as participating in the Hatch has been one of the better investments in crypto (beating the price of ETH by over 2x)

- Co-developed Praise and spun it out to be its own independent project, focused on becoming a reputation system and rewards distribution tool. We open-sourced the deployment and supported several communities in using it.

 - Worked on-the-ground in Kenya with Grassroots Economics to understand the needs for their complex economic model and jointly explore possible solutions.

- Initiated the ‚ÄúLaunch a Commons‚Äù campaign to engage purpose-driven web3 communities in becoming tokenized communities that will create and steward public goods.

The NFTs are minted on Polygon (an Ethereum layer 2 network) and the bot covers the gas costs.

On successful minting, your NFTs are visible and tradeable on marketplaces (which support Polygon) such as Opensea. All users mint NFTs under their own contract/collection (tied to their telegram username)

The service has since expanded to provide free & gas-less ENS subdomains via Twitter. Gas-less registrations are achieved through EIP-3668: (CCIP Read: Secure offchain data retrieval)  - the same technology utilized by Coinbase with their free cb.id subdomains. The names can be resolved via rainbow wallet, Coinbase wallet, trust wallet & Metamask.

üîÜ What is BrightID?
BrightID is building an identity lego that allows users to prove to applications that they only exist once in any given system.

What if you could always prove you were a real unique user?
It‚Äôs easy in the real world to ensure you‚Äôre dealing with a unique or a specific person, but imagine how many systems could be improved or made possible if every user or account could prove they only exist once as we transition to the digital era?

* Digital voting and governance - including quadratic voting, liquid democracy, and signaling
* Truly universal income or airdrop distributions payable to literally everyone
* Public-goods funding allocation - trust minimized and collusion resistant thanks to MACI
* Social media without millions of bots polluting the discourse
* Credit systems for under-collateralized DeFi
* And so much more...

üîÜ How does it work?
BrightID is creating a giant pseudonymous social graph of people all around the world. Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts. The user can then use their BrightID verification to prove to any integrated system that they have one and only one account. The potential integrations are endless.

üîÜ Where will my contributions go?
BrightID Main DAO is a LAO (a DAO with a legal wrapper) that stewards centralized pieces until they can be decentralized, such as the app registry, website, and app store entries. It also has stewardship over grant and sponsorship income, and functions as a non-profit. It has been committed to BrightID‚Äôs core mission and funded the core team since its inception in Feb 2020.
100% of contributed funds will go to BMAIN DAO.

üîÜ Bright DAO!
Bright DAO pulls in many contributors from the community to grow BrightID at a faster pace. Using the gardens DAO format pioneered by 1Hive, contributors can create their own proposals and receive their own funding in $BRIGHT community governance tokens.

To use tokens in decentralised applications such as Uniswap you have to grant the application permission to spend tokens on your behalf - known as an allowance. Allowances are an important part of using these apps, but can be dangerous if left unchecked.

Bugs can exists and exploits can happen even in established projects, and by approving token allowances you are potentially exposing your wallet to these exploits. To keep yourself safe from allowance exploits it is a good practice to regularly inspect and revoke your allowances.

Revoke.cash comes in as a preventative tool to manage your token allowances and practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active allowances you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of allowance exploits.

In many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an allowance while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases. When these phishing scams happen, it is recommended to use Revoke.cash to mitigate the damage, but it is even better to prevent the scam in the first place.

This is where the Revoke.cash Browser Extension comes in. The extension pops up whenever you are about to sign an allowance and will inform you of the allowance details.

GiveStation is a multi-chain give-to-earn grant protocol that rewards users for funding projects, ideas and public goods in web3. GiveStation is decentralized which means anyone can create a grant anytime and get grants approved by a consensus vote from the contributiors.

Problem?

The main driving factor for the success of crowdfunding was the ability to raise funds by just making some short description of what you want to raise funds for and then submit it on platforms like Kickstarter, GoFundme, etc.

However, later it turned out that this model was polluted and centralized crowdfunding platform does little or no background checks and follow-up on the projects.

The crowdfunding community is too centralized and while the Contributors are being screwed for donating and trusting a project/idea, they end up not seeing the impact of their contributions.

There is almost no room from transparency by default. This a huge challenge for every of the traditional crowdfunding ecosystem, and that is what we are here to fix.

Lesson learned:

We have learnt that web3 is the tool needed to solve this problem once an for all.

Contributors should be empowered by recurring incentives for the value they create according to the level of impact.

Contributors are the backbone of every crowdfunding system.

Solution

Our mission is reward and protect the contributors while making sure that the funds allocated to this founders and teams are used in the right way.

Incentivization

To encourage Contributors to participate in funding projects and to also experience a better community while contributing to the GiveStation‚Äôs ecosystem, we have put together a reward mechanism.

To paint a better scenario - At the end of each funding round, contributors will be able to claim GVST token as additional rewards.

Governance and Decentralization

On GiveStation, the community governing system which most of its missions and goals are largely influenced by votes and users are granted flexibility and control not otherwise seen with traditional crowdfunding models.

If Contributors matters a lot in the crowdfunding system then introducing a transparent way to raise fund is the best way to raise funds and this it will not only protect the Contributors, it also creates an atmosphere of trust where the Contributors know where his/her donations go to and how its being used.

Overview Project Overview

After the funding is completed. There will be no disbursement of funds if the grant does not get at least 50% approval vote from its donors.

How it works:

The creators/team creates a project,

They hit their target from contributions.

They make funds withdrawal request.

Funds get sent to their provided wallet after at least 50% of donors have approved the withdrawal request.

Furthermore, our medium article here explains how we take care of KYC and compliance to prevent rogue grants creators/team from listing projects for the aim of defrauding the system.

We are currently on the Gitcoin grants round and the little we have raised so far along with our personal team funds has helped us build the project to the stage it is today and we plan and hope to raise more to introduce more features soon.

The goal is to incentivize the web3 ecosystem by integrating token rewards for users who contributes to projects on each of this blockchain protocols.

Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?

User incentivization - We believe ideas can get funding from VCs and all but user acquistion is whole different journey and while other dapps are focusing on exchange, defi, swap, etc Givestation is creating a platform where public goods can get funding with no middle man while rewarding the users which are the pillars and real reason these ideas come to live.

On the other hand, building a project can take a lot of time and the idea may end up on the shelf not because its not good enough, but funding in the industry seem to be tilting towards a certain part and that‚Äôs why we are creating a p2p grant ecosystem where donors meets creators, create an impact by donating and also be in charge of how/when funds are released.

With this solution, we expect to see a major increase in number of developers and builders coming to build very good projects while contributors who will later turn to users will also stay to support as there is now an instant reward for them.

Who can raise funds on GiveStation - GiveStation is accessible to everybody as long as you have a great idea. Regardless of your country, tribe, race, etc.

Progress Our Dapp is on testnet on five blockchains inclusing Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Polygon and Binance.

Users can create and contribute to grants and claim Givepoints (GP) on their dashboard.

While we were at this stage, we saw what bringing the protocol to other chain could mean for the crowdfunding ecosystem and what the subsequent version will look like including features like:

Some new features like Hosting of hackathons for other projects will be introduced in the next update.

Differentiation The platform is not limited to developers and web programmers alone as we have made the platform available for everybody as long as they need funds to bring their ideas into reality.

Any user can visit the platform, pick any idea or project they believe in, contribute directly to this life changing projects and in doing so, they get rewarded.

The requested funds will serve as a bridge to launch the new, ready-for-prime-time version of GiveStation. Expenses include:

Marketing

Design and branding .

Governance, airdrop, staking, and/or liquidity
