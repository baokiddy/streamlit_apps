This allows iOS/MacOS developers to work in their native interfaces. As a result, the library greatly improves developer productivity, and helps fulfill the vision of decentralized applications.\n\nThere are several other open-source projects in the field of web3swift, such as [Web3 (0.4.1)](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift), [Web3Swift.io](https://github.com/zeriontech/Web3Swift), [web3swift.pod](https://github.com/bankex/web3swift), etc. But in terms of the technologies adopted, our library is yet the most advanced one tha\u3119 most of them, since we have full support of such features as **TxPool, ENS, event loops, etc**. Our library is therefore more widely used by the community.\n\n\nWe provide the community with **convenient tools** to work with Ethereum blockchain in Swift. Developers can therefore attain the ability to **quickly create secure decentralized applications** for Apple devices, without studying cryptography beforehand. This allows developers to focus on the content quality and UX/UI in DApps, which in turn **increases the adoption** of Ethereum blockchain and facilitates community growth.\n\nThe library was an essential part in several winning projects at ETHBerlin2018 and ETHDenver2019. We made it possible to work with Ethereum from mobile devices. Nowdays, our library is one of the most used iOS/MacOS libraries for Ethereum, and it was used in almost all ETH-related hackhathons.\n\nOur project is in great demand, more than 10 dApps have been using our [codes in production](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift#projects-that-are-using-web3swift), such as [Loopring](https://github.com/Loopring/loopr-ios?files=1), [PeepETH](https://github.com/matter-labs/PeepethClient), [ENSWallet](https://github.com/barrasso/enswallet), and many others. We have [more than 1000 references](https://github.com/search?p=4&amp;q=pod+%27web3swift%27&amp;type=Code) in GitHub.\n\nAs the library is so popular, our users also keep pushing for updates. There are  [several new features requests (25 open issues for now)](https://github.com/matter-labs/web3swift/issues). But since this is the team's open-source side project, we can&#39;t spend the money we raised with Matter Labs to support it, especially when it&#39;s unrelated to the main goal of Matter Labs: To scale Ethereum.\n\nWe already put in a vast amount of work to support the most used functionalities, including the following:\n\n- \u26a1 Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality\n- \ud83d\udcad Interaction with remote node via **JSON RPC**\n- \ud83d\udd10 Local **keystore management** (geth compatible)\n- \ud83e\udd16 Smart-contract **ABI parsing**\n- \ud83d\udd13 **ABI deconding** (V2 is supported with return of structures from public functions. Part of 0.4.22 Solidity compiler)\n- \ud83d\udd78 **(ENS) support** - a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Smart contracts interactions** (read/write)\n- \u26e9 **Infura support** , partial Websockets API support\n- \u2692 **Parsing TxPool** content into native values (ethereum addresses and transactions) - easy to get pending transactions\n- \ud83d\udd87 **Event loops** functionality\n- \ud83d\udcf1 Supports Web3View functionality (WKWebView with **injected &quot;web3&quot;

Motivation:\nWe identified a few key issues with the current state of DeFi.\n- High operational burden to constantly monitor yields and health factor especially if users have multiple positions\n- Low capital efficiency from a lot of manual operations\n- Poor UX from a lack of support for tools like automation/notification bots\n\n\nOur Solution:\nLoanshark offers the following features:\n- Automated position management toolbox that allows users to create workflows that span multiple protocols (e.g. Set up a workflow that automatically withdraws funds from farms and then repay your debt based on health factor and/or interest rates)\n- Simple and protocol agnostic interface for borrowers to originate loans\n- Aggregated liquidity across different lending platforms to offer the lowest rates\n\n\nDemo video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sO5kgp_CJg\n\n\nJourney since GR14\nJuly: Joined \"Startup with Chainlink\" Program and demoed on Binance Live.\nAugust: Launched our closed beta\n\n\nJourney since GR15\nOctober: Added automatic debt repayment as a possible workflow action\nNovember: Rebranding with a complete UI refresh\nDecember: Added action history to allow users to check all their automation history\n\n\nRoadmap \nFebruary: Public V2 Testnet (Get whitelisted at https://forms.gle/uTZVqZDPezYhtf2v6.)", "website": "https://loanshark.tech", "bannerImg":

ERC721s & fully integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). They can be resolved on L1 Ethereum by utilizing an off-chain resolver.\n\nImportant Links:\n\nGithub: https://github.com/stevegachau/optimismresolver\n\nOff-chain Resolver on L1 - https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain NFTs on Optimism - https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9fb848300e736075ed568147259bf8a8eefe4fef#code\n\nSubdomain Example on ENS App - https://app.ens.domains/name/nick.ecc.eth/details\n\nSubdomain Example on Etherscan - https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Rainbow Wallet - https://rainbow.me/nick.ecc.eth\n\nSubdomain Example on Opensea - https://opensea.io/assets/optimism/0x9fb848300E736075eD568147259bF8a8eeFe4fEf/2\n\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nThis project is leading the charge in making it easier & cheaper to acquire and utilize ens domains. We are implementing the latest technologies released by the ENS team (CCIP Read & Off-chain resolution) to make it possible for users to register subdomains on Optimism while making them available & resolvable on L1 Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to providing free ENS subdomain on Optimism (currently ecc.eth), OptiNames is partnering with NFT projects & gaming communities building their games on any Layer 2. These communities will be utilizing our tech and smart contracts to provide free usernames & gamer-tags that double up as ENS subdomains.\n\nAdoption:\n\nThe first project utilizing Optinames to issue subdomains to their community is ECC Name Service. ECC Name Service has since grown to become the Number 1 domain collection on Optimism.\n\nRegistrations: 17,725\n\nWhat Next?: Optinames is working on and will soon be launching ENS Wildcards on L2\n\nMany NFT communities on Ethereum and L2s have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, requiring each NFT holder to manually register an ENS subdomain can be cumbersome. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names.\n\nWildcard subdomains offer a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder to receive an ENS name automatically at no cost & without any registration step. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (linked to an NFTs token ID) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection.\n", "website": "https://optinames.eth.limo", "bannerImg": "bafybeidzfmpm6ua2lviqprjznrp4qcj54ihyuiaoliry5ldktygaysthhq", "logoImg": "bafkreig6io7p6k3q53wbu4h3qz7cbnkcrldatu54tlxioej4ovby2gd7yq", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreidlknkjnz4hrgqq67m75s5fzikueuxt3lqib7xgsfscdng2ldllxe"}, "userGithub": "stevegachau", "projectGithub": "stevegachau/optimismresolver", "projectTwitter": "OptiNames", "credentials": {"twitter": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x1208a26FAa0F4AC65B42098419EB4dAA5e580AC6", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}], "hash": "v0.0.0:zj78rZgjM8zMmI9vOQ7+jGKDe85/M38oJYzjqiaDsvM=", "provider": "ClearTextTwitter#OptiNames"}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-15T09:45:10.133Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-15T09:45:10.133Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..ERrmBR3nXVBjrbMq3z9h3imSniXMJcxHY18On_FsIXvfEO2yhWmy8OKJjTkyXY8isaX6MGdlWRcVDl0EkZnpAg"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-15T09:45:10.133Z"}}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "hGFgHmosVx5fczl3HkWMiwAxZGv2V2EzO52b32MjYqI=", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "84fded4bd0bec3b259a9864dc4205e8024ac2067360ec4badf301a71d3891999e57988a3aac28ebc0e1c351d92c5081676e98967d8ad02b58110abf54550f734240ef499880f66016db8caa087a087a0b86d0f5cae9c91e72ea6d35005e172a9b8e0cb0b382096fdd2efd93f334e85e2d6356ce103f19c38f2db2de5f547af670000000000000020ac0c982bf89421089a43d1d0c7d26662a6777816ac77edfcab930b9a85d728493d059eef87127340a50b8d19b6ce9cab"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Gitcoin Grants"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "2"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/stevegachau"}]}}}, {"id": "0x41963755a6073b9828e00e9c0b715d5763d1a1447505aa3ed7964d88269f6c24-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0x41963755a6073b9828e00e9c0b715d5763d1a1447505aa3ed7964d88269f6c24", "status": "REJECTED", "payoutAddress": "0xf0dBDe527c63B63178576578777f0b7E24755ABb", "createdAt": "1673096303", "updatedAt": "1673096303", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreigoq5cldtyz53nb56stoztoiw36leijzsn7p3h3xgi523al3a3tei"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x32ac4b14626637e5272959d5dd72e6932395d6348496dc0d422f6b06224a248e5293e874b5f86a53d7e5bbce9aab5e16d7856eecb87a46998c760d96ff0fef1b1b", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0xf0dBDe527c63B63178576578777f0b7E24755ABb", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673094061335, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:66", "title": "Using ZK for game optimization in Dark Forest", "description": "A development team focused on Dark Forest,\nworking on a more user-friendly gaming environment.\nDark Forest is an MMO strategy game built with zkSNARKs on Ethereum and xDAI.

For example, when one reports that her account is leaked:\n\nMulti-signature wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe) should ban this account.\nWeb3 email providers (e.g., MetaMail) in which users log in with signatures should suspend everybody's access to emails of this account to protect the privacy of the original owner.\nElectronic agreements based on ETH accounts (e.g., ETHSign) should disqualify this account from signing new agreements. Because the new agreements signed may not be authorized by the original owner.\nTo solve the above problems, we propose the 0xdeadlist.io project to maintain a list of addresses whose private keys have been leaked. By rewarding the burier NFT (Non-fungible token), 0xDeadList encourages users and hackers to report accounts with leaked private keys, and stores the information of these leaked accounts on the chain to facilitate DApps project parties to query these insecure accounts.\n\nWhat it does\n0xDeadList is a public good that encourages users to collect and report addresses whose private keys are leaked. Users can directly log in to 0xdeadlist.io to report the leaked address. The main contract of 0xDeadList provides two steps (lock address and bury address) to report leaked addresses under the following considerations:\n\nPreventing the reporter's NFT reward from being stolen by front-running attacks.\nEnsuring the reporter has enough time before the private key of the leaked address is fully disclosed.\nIn step 1, the reporter locks the address to be buried, and the contract records the address of the reporter. At this time, the private key of the locked address will not be disclosed.\n\nIn step 2, the user uploads the private key of the locked address in step 1, and the reporter address recorded in the contract will receive an NFT reward, indicating that the address is buried, and the buried (or say, leaked) address will receive a tombstone SBT (Soul Bound Token), which is not transferable. In step 2, the private key of the buried address will be made public (recorded on-chain), ensuring the leaked address is indeed leaked.\n\nThe 0xDeadList project is fully open-sourced, and here are

Erich: https://github.com/ErichDylus\n\nCodeslaw is a meme of the \"code is law\" & \"work in public\" web3 virtues, integrated with the 'code deference' legal philosophy pioneered by LeXpunK army and refined by LexDAO contributors. \n\nIf we think of Solidity \"smart contracts\" as codeslaw initially invented by legal engineer Nick Szabo, then it's apparent that codeslaw is one of the most important forms of OSS in web3. \n\nCodeslaw is for the 'unlawed' what Proof of Work is for the 'unbanked' https://distributed-autonomous-society.quora.com/The-Unlawed . \n\nMost of our members are cryptolawyers and legal engineers, but that's not a requirement. All codeslaw fans are welcome!\n\nAs a DAO, we fund a variety of internal & external projects that span the multidisciplinary requirements of codeslaw public goods & services. \n\nLexDAO does a lot of codeslaw pro bono work, ensuring the funds we have get the job done regardless. Sometimes codeslaw is more important than money!\n\nAll donations to this Gitcoin Round will be used by our DAO to directly pay for OSS codeslaw development. Additionally, we always prioritize positive impact DAO and projects that offer valuable practical-web3-experience student education opportunities. \n\nIf you'd like to get involved in LexDAO governance, membership is open to everyone! Please visit http://lexdao.chat to join our community and subscribe to our newsletter at https://lexdao.substack.com .\n\nSupport codeslaw by proudly wearing this designer hat https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/codeslaw-hat !\n\nOur legacy cGrants page https://gitcoin.co/grants/4811/lexdao-providing-legal-aid-to-impactdaos-funded-by .

We are organizing blockchain events and courses for everyone. We have many students who are ready to improve themselves in this technology.\n\nOur Free Solidity Course is Supported by Ethereum Foundation!!!\n\nWe've been published a free Solidity Course (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLby2HXktGwN4Cof_6a8YwlMrboX8-hs73) on our Youtube channel. The total duration of the course is approximately 20+ hours. The voiceover of the course was made in Turkish. As we continue to expand our Solidity course, we would like to announce that this education is supported by the Ethereum Foundation from now on.\n\n--ETH Barcelona--\n\nOur teammates took part in ETH Barcelona both as volunteers and as participants. Our volunteer friends have gained a lot of experience on how to organize an event on a global scale. They shared their experiences with us. With these experiences, we will make future events in Turkey better.\n\n--Cryptist Istanbul Meetup--\n\nWe organized and participated in Cryptist Istanbul, the first zero knowledge-focused community event in Turkey. We took part as a team in the event attended by very important speakers and we found various networking opportunities.\n\n--ETH Prague Hackathon--\n\nWe participated in the Ethereum Prague Hackathon with our project on sustainability. We had the chance to meet and communicate with expert developers in the ecosystem.\n\n--Avalanche Barcelona Summit | Hackathon--\n\nAs ITU Blockchain, we came back as the team that received the most rewards from Avalanche Barcelona Hackathon. We returned to Istanbul with 2 different rewards in total.\n\nLayerZero Best Usecase Reward\n\nCoinbase Best Team Reward\n\n--Avalanche Hacks Istanbul--\n\nWe've completed Hackathon at 2nd place. It was an event where we gained a lot of experience and knowledge.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/itublockchain\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/itublockchain\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/itublockchain\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@ITUBlockchain/", "website": "https://itublockchain.com", "bannerImg": "bafybeiflxewjwbpbtutbozfas6bct46mrrcmtwyy3hqyuhy6jww2xdjobm", "logoImg": "bafybeidsdbrgzvxiql5shhsbv6czjegimiulltoowyg4kwafd7zsvmuuly", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreih4vax7nnbgx4pb5jdauq3da7yje445ddiey3ms64xs3sq7m6at2a"}, "userGithub": "ismailemin", "projectGithub": "itublockchain", "projectTwitter": "ITUblockchain", "credentials": {"twitter": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xBEC643BD5b7F5e9190617CA4187ef0455950C51C", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}], "provider": "ClearTextTwitter#ITUblockchain", "hash": "v0.0.0:A76Lefp2oHM/zQrwqhNaS/SriRl6u5g98A0PKALMW/U="}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-07T22:06:41.333Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-07T22:06:41.334Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..xgMcgatRZPlC5HRv5q-BZQVN9mU968HpvO0_MrpmdMcf219DG8eYGL3PiL39x4khBQawUtXoA7jTa9RrKO8RBA"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-07T22:06:41.333Z"}}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "EELrncxDSbuOhr8P7hG3JEFomTMv/DWJogTC9ptpYMju1XjTDacAp4xKP+UfctTP", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "3ec0a417f3e6d4c31cf9dd5c1ede7f5fc95f1279ac54d5bee2c95288a25ddcc5a3e650cac7f94d799d118858a83bbc0b889a3936d92ace97f0c18cf7e58f79bbc318ef1e6cf594199c7ecb14b6dcd51171c8335559c50e5ba9ac2e5ef7d3a880fbf0ca98ab7f3d587280fcf9d4c82b852ce5f7e75c7269de82dbd2232315c0780000000000000020df5902a11cd308909a94db90fe048cb5ceafccd5d4c149e81344016f128a6c8dbe990c047c9e586181f88bd630210a8e"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "ITU Blockchain is a public good.

Jolocom has been supporting and driving the mission of Self-sovereign Identity since 2014. We are a founding member of DWeb, INATBA, Bundesblock and also long-time supporters and active members of DIF, the IIW and W3C. We joined the Gitcoin-Community in early 2022, together with our friends from DWeb and the Internet Archive. \n\n \n\nJolocom is committed to upholding the principles of SSI and has developed a fully open-source tech stack to that end, consisting of a library, an SDK and Smart Wallet for end users. During the infancy of digital identity, this has brought us to the forefront of development houses in Germany and Europe and also to the attention of regulators and lawmakers. Among other things, we are the chosen tech providers in three quarters of the German government\u2019s Secure Digital Identity showcase projects.\n\nNow, though, we are seeing the mature phase of digital identity approaching: by end of 2023, every EU citizen will be asked to hold an \"identity wallet.\" But will that identity be Self-Sovereign? In other words, will citizens and users finally be in control of their own identity data or will it be under the control of a monopolistic centralized authorities or oligopolistic federated actors?\n\n \n\nFor Jolocom to continue building open source, not-for-profit SSI solutions, as we have for the last eight years, and to further establish EU and global standards for interoperability in decentralized identity, we need to scale at the same speed as the growing market. And here we need your help. \n\n \n\nIn the aforementioned Secure Digital Identity (SDI) Projects of the German government we are building out the Jolocom SmartWallet to integrate different government services, bridge between different services and industry actors via the Jolocom Issuer and Verifier Agent, while also partnering with researchers and experts to prepare a UI/UX design ready for mass adoption.

To achieve that, we are building the Vocdoni Protocol, a censorship-resistant, secure, anonymous and transparent voting protocol to facilitate decision-making for communities and organizations regardless of whether they are digital natives or traditional organizations.\n\nFor implementing the voting protocol, Vocdoni developed the Vochain [2], a public voting blockchain, as well as a set of tools that facilitate its usage such as an API [3], an SDK [4] and a dApp. Today, this technology serves numerous organizations around the world by providing them with a secure, transparent, easy-to-use and low-cost voting system.\n\nThe main initiatives for the 2023 Roadmap are:\n1. Voting-as-a-service: Commoditize voting\n2. Enhanced Web3 protocol: Anonymous gasless voting with verifiable onchain execution\n3. Increase decentralization: Migrating to Proof-of-Stake blockchain\n\nMore info at:\nhttps://vocdoni.io\nhttps://developer.vocdoni.io\n\n [1] https://aragonorg.notion.site/Mission-Vision-Values-8cbbef15826d4e0889aaf7f35b3a622a\n[2] https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-node\n[3] https://developer.vocdoni.io/category/vocdoni-api\n[4] https://developer.vocdoni.io/sdk", "website": "https://vocdoni.io", "bannerImg": "bafkreibgj6f5aon7flfme3cl7e44xvc5u4ipuaxgo5isrspmiskgbcfene", "logoImg": "bafkreidwmtunbranukh7tlapdehdcxb2sbjiiwn5h73upoibjoop2b4ywm", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreidzvqv5yse7pozr73qeldmsayz5minn5nm5tiir2a4ff4noubi2d4"}, "userGithub": "", "projectGithub": "vocdoni", "projectTwitter": "vocdoni", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "cJvqztnsj6+3Hr8AWELgPjUzjovo1L/a40s8j9Rl6/U=", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "b1479b20b1f8b5670fc0a344b98d07df8f857faff6dc52f706a7015da79896489a2bf7e2fd1f0f70a783f2ca1bda6a057ea2b9dd9faf48d4a846a0749c34e5fe1bcac44a58585ca073df8dcd238604f11331d31780a46078b3d2e38fd0ba86b5e2833e03628e1c43c68dd9d08b3b894bdd2e11cfaa90c6e5315be1f06974ea4e0000000000000020f48f6ee76fec714810cbc21eb924caf54dd381a8f05a3bce6a78b3b09a2e4b14aa6392ed9752af840fcb673651217c88"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "For 2023 we'll potentially receive some funding through AragonDAO (vote pending)"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "10"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/vocdoni || https://github.com/ferranrego"}]}}}, {"id": "0x526dfc66cd504a06e7908438a4041aa473e73677492d91849f69f45fe81e160f-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0x526dfc66cd504a06e7908438a4041aa473e73677492d91849f69f45fe81e160f", "status": "APPROVED", "payoutAddress": "0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02", "createdAt": "1673091671", "updatedAt": "1673091671", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreiemazi3lwaemvve5gzllkcueat6ulw6kn4gzynffiudiqun4w3lpq"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0xdd43c3cf7fd0af4dbccb40a316ef692b9453f4d2353c6113ad761fcb5b6da2397f5ec849f99d80d9be14a3574904cd92aead96cb7bf951ff1f3b25ceeb3037e400", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673091092164, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:65", "title": "Web3 OSS Libraries by DePay", "description": "At DePay we strive to open source as much of our creations and internal libraries as possible.

Climate research today needs to focus immediately on practical solutions. We need research that leads to mass movements and exponentially growing impact. Like the US Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E), the Climate Research bundle will be a key engine of climate innovation and climate action. While fixing our sights on the high bar set by ARPA-E is wildly ambitious, we know that blockchain technology can exponentially increase effective and efficient scientific research. Integrated indicators make the research replicable and scalable and allow improved documentation and verification. The ambitious and innovative projects in the Climate Research bundle will architect many systems of the new infrastructure of climate research and scientific collaboration. \n\nThis bundle is comprised of 8 critical and interrelated projects address various challenges of climate research by generating:\n\n\u26a1 Clean, cheap, abundant, and reliable sources of energy and the need to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on cities and urban areas.\n\n\ud83d\udca8 Increased speed and efficiency of traditional methods for conducting and translating scientific research\n\n\ud83e\udd2f Solutions to the complex set of root causes that contribute to the long time it takes for scientific research to be implemented in real life\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Increased transparency, traceability, and access to funding for scientific research\n\n\ud83e\uddbe Effective mechanisms to protect intellectual property, reduced investor risk in, and increased investor access to the scientific and technological innovation process\n\n\ud83e\udd11 Profitable ways for companies to align with community values related to climate change\n\n\ud83d\udd2c More effective research, and strategies for promoting and supporting scientific innovation that positively impacts the world and its inhabitants\n\n\ud83c\udf31 Developing regenerative data tech, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage\n\nThe projects contributing to this effort are:\n\n\ud83c\udf0e FrontierDAO\n\ud83c\udf0e SCINET\n\ud83c\udf0e Option\n\ud83c\udf0e ScienceFund\n\ud83c\udf0e Internet of Animals\n\ud83c\udf0e Defi Biolabs\n\ud83c\udf0e Circonomy\n\ud83c\udf0e Grow Your Own Cloud DAO (GYOC DAO)\n\nFrontierDAO @FrontierDAO;  Collectively incubating scientific and engineering innovations and innovators, using Web3 tooling (linktr.ee/frontierdao).\n\nOne of our key focus areas is \u201cfusion energy as a climate solution.\u201d Fusion energy, while still in its infancy, is the technology that will usher in a new era on this planet - one where cheap, clean, abundant, baseload energy is available for all. \n\nNuclear fusion energy is the energy of the stars and sun. It is the opposite of nuclear fission.. \n\nTo help usher in this new era of transition to clean energy, FrontierDAO has released in BETA an IP NFT on-chain scientific publishing platform called FrontierRegistry. By publishing research on the blockchain, we aim to foster greater collaboration while protecting authors\u2019 IP rights. frontierda.xyz/faqs-projects\n\nFunds raised from GR15 were used to partially underwrite a 12-week Fusion Energy As A Climate Solution weekly workshop series that ran from November to mid-January. Interviews can be found on Youtube.com/@frontierdao.                           \n\nSCINET, INC @scinet_inc. At SCINET, we are increasing the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of life sciences research from \u201clab to life\u201d by developing a suite of software applications in a decentralized (\"DeSci\") life sciences ecosystem that addresses the complex set of root causes for why it takes 17 years for life sciences research, including climate solutions, to get into real life (see here for socials, media mentions, website, etc.).\n\nWe help scientists conduct and translate research faster, more accurately, and more efficiently by offering them a unique confluence of decentralized funding, blockchain-protected IP, unique trust mechanisms, and commercialization strategies that reduce investor risk, increase scientific innovation, protect intellectual property, and positively impact the world and its inhabitants.\n\nOption, @option_hq: Option is a prediction market for governance that incentivizes companies to align with community values, including those related to climate change, by making it profitable for them to do so. An example of climate governance using Option could be creating a market where players can make predictions about a company's carbon emissions reduction targets. If the company meets its targets, those who predicted accurately would be rewarded. This would incentivize the company to align with community values and reduce its carbon emissions in order to profit from the market. Furthermore, the funding provided by the market could be used to support research and journalism focused on climate change and carbon emissions reduction.\n\nScience Fund, @sciencefund_io: Fund basic science with donations recorded for posterity on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nScience Fund is empowering scientists to freely, openly, and rapidly pursue their best scientific ideas. To achieve this, we are reimagining how discovery is funded. No grant applications. Transparent, traceable funding records. Rapid funding cycles that support more ideas early and continue funding what\u2019s working. In this Gitcoin Round, we plan to test some of the mechanisms we thought out. At least 80% of the funds collected in this round will go towards our first Climate Action funding pool, the \u201cUrban Climate Impact Mitigation Pool\u201d. \n\nSpecifically we will support \u201cUPP\u201d - the \u201cUrban Planting Project\u201d incubated at the AKASHA Hub in Barcelona. UPPs mission is to turn every available city space into green islands of chill. By easing heat stress, UPP is helping to mitigate the effects of climate change and promote new sources for local food production in cities. UPP has already formed partnerships with local universities and communities to deploy its \u201cUPP toolbox\u201d and will apply S.M.A.R.T. principles to quantify the project's impact both through technology including real-time tracking, and satellite imagery as well as by documenting the social impact of their project.\n\nDonors to our Gitcoin grant will be recorded in the funding pool through their Ethereum addresses and will receive certificates of the impact that allows them to unlock information and data about the project\u2019s success at regular intervals in the future. \n\nInternet of Animals, @WildlifeMovemnt: Our mission is to create a community of scientists that promotes the design, development, implementation, and improvement of accessibility to software, hardware, and knowledge resources related to wildlife movement ecology. To realize that vision, we formed The Wildlife Movement Institute, a nonprofit organization to be a hub for this community for local, regional, and international collaborations \u2013 whether you are an expert or someone passionate about wildlife and technology. Since the end of GR15 we have established a bank account, set up a business account on CoinBase and are now preparing to invest in web development and getting 501(c)(3) tax status. \n\nDefi Biolabs, @Defibiolabs: Bioengineering algae to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nGR15 Grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/7497/defi-biolabs-is-engineering-cyanobacteria-to-prod\n\nCirconomy, @CirconomyDAO: Recycle & Reuse 2 Earn 2 put the \u201ceco\u201d in \u201ceconomy\u201d (https://www.circon.me). \n\nWe aspire to become a DAO platform to proliferate circular economic projects all over the world. We'll accomplish this by building a dapp which will have a combination of on-chain registration of hardware-based circular economic projects such as Precious Plastic. This will be crowdfunded to ensure common ownership and stakeholdership. This will be supported by on-chain tracking of all recycling activity which will have a recycle-2-eajjrn cryptoeconomics model underpinning it.\n\nWe are currently creating a crypto-back solution for the world of recycling & reusing. We\u2019ll accomplish this by tokenizing existing points-based recycling/reuse-2-earn programs administered by not-for-profit organizations such as Circulr.ca and RedeemClothingRecycling.com. This allows us to better empower end users with an interoperable incentive that would have a unified reward pool amongst all of our partners as well as grant more autonomy to our partners to scale their operations.\n\nThe high-level summary of our tokenomics is as follows - there will be a dual-token system whereby:\nThe token users will earn will be created by coalitions between brands and nonprofits so what we mean by this is - depending on the material in question and/or other factors, we\u2019ll have coalitions of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that will mint a utility token together for earning. As an example - ideally, all clothing-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that handle clothing recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable fashion brands. Likewise, all plastic-recycling will have one utility token governed by all nonprofits that deal with plastic recycling whilst the for-profits will be sustainable toy/merch companies. In that latter example, there may be multiple coalitions given that the toy industry is a specific/niche market. But regardless, we\u2019re starting with the fashion industry as our MVP.\n\nThis utility token will not be tradable in the exchanges because Circonomy itself will have a token that will be liquid in the exchanges out there. This token will be token-bonded to the utility tokens within Circonomy\u2019s ecosystem and thus in order for users to either obtain other utility tokens or liquidate them, they\u2019ll have to exchange their utility token for the Circonomy token. Each utility token will be exchangeable for rewards such as discounts or exclusive access to brand events that are token-gated or NFT phygital goods. But if they don\u2019t care about those things, they may simply liquidate by way of exchanging for the Circonomy token and then selling their Circonomy token, or they may stake the Circonomy token for gains of course and helping to drive value.\n\nGrow Your Own Cloud, @_GYOC: develops regenerative data technology, storing digital data in the DNA of plants and trees, to create carbon absorbing data storage. \n\nIt works! We\u2019ve just been awarded the science breakthrough of the year from Falling Walls for our functional prototype 'Data Garden'. We\u2019ve also just finished an EU-funded research project that demonstrates how urban scale implementations of GYOC could absorb megatonnes of carbon and store terabytes of data.\n\nNow we\u2019re developing a unique Web3 offering we call \"Non-Fungible Plants\" (NFPs). NFPs are physical plants with data encoded within their DNA. Data like JPEGs and MP3s. They\u2019re the first truly plant-based NFTs ever created. They\u2019re the first step to build data systems that work in harmony with living systems for maximum positive impact.\n\nTo enable our vision, within Web3 we are forming GYOC DAO: an internet-native organization dedicated to accelerating the transition to truly green data storage. Funds raised through this bundle will help the continued growth of an organization which more closely resembles a public good than a traditional tech company. Together we can create a future where server farms could be replaced by data forests. \n\n", "website": "https://www.notion.so/Climate-Research-Bundle-Project-Description-4254cf8973f14b428feacc157dbc2021", "bannerImg": "bafybeibpeazvzjn4eewcj2t3p4ylifuxlurgwz3hhkml3vh5ux7ebgdqza", "logoImg": "bafybeidgeo5rhrpc4lly4e3gpjwim4zyatofeg4wbflpmmbhr26dh23bpy", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreiah6du6ip5csrtwedu2qdlaubg5hadxsr536auvrfrjtt6aefk6zq"}, "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "qo7sJerGy4hhu9eQ3GAKoD33NF5MtcprW1ly+sjiRKajVfYqahaAiEWSdlg+iL9z", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "dbddbd0b65eb3ee4bb329bed0e2522bbbd9ad1fbe90aa5ffc9f8f3cf631a53730159e422905d89a8e0a584727192a404bb2ee9f6534a3674f27e5f0e44007787796e59e6ea24889274140d3820a2717518fd45300853ae275ddb591403aaf1b29eb2bd7236bfb628905130cd5e4d24fa30cdba82e840ad7b0cc6c45863cce6b600000000000000200f095877c57dfaafee95088ec58fb594541c59266ff1f0122d0420fd4b58fee9b5ef5ea0071561cc2ba73c5259ad9799"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Grants"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "8"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/SCINETCEO"}]}}}, {"id": "0x5cabeac8c52fc68df9dc828a716566aef8e34b3d7e95de43ed8ee1e36a795e6f-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0x5cabeac8c52fc68df9dc828a716566aef8e34b3d7e95de43ed8ee1e36a795e6f", "status": "REJECTED", "payoutAddress": "0x4a903f36037da9dc1e1992bc7b8d511170000b07", "createdAt": "1673043623", "updatedAt": "1673043623", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreihzvr7ofjaeyk4xbe2dhldyfc7kk46z4sejzy5rpx7fnk6tta4t6q"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x1f07026cb7dc502f691f6a1708bee12d6a5982b34945ef0c8ba7873e7040894d431e7fa954c0efab939bde564183ff2d5f1c375245fdafbc8826b8dc789b76f81c", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x4a903f36037da9dc1e1992bc7b8d511170000b07", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673043434222, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:52", "title": "ENS DAO Newsletter", "description": "A bi-weekly summary of the developments and happenings within ENS, ENS DAO, and its working groups.\n\nThe ENS DAO Newsletter started in March 2022 with the objective of providing transparency for ENS through publication of a bi-weekly newsletter -- An easy to read summary of the latest news and discussions designed to reach the widest audience possible.\n\nThe ENS DAO Newsletter editors stay up-to-date with what is happening in ENS every single day, so you don't have to.

We believe DAOs can provide a path forward where knowledge is decentralized and talent is unlocked for the betterment of society. \n \nThere\u2019s just one problem: The science of DAOs is yet to be known; it must be explored. It must be learned. Traditional scientific settings are largely broken due to outdated institutional norms, obsolete academic infrastructure, and inefficient funding models. So without hesitation, a team of researchers has taken the plunge down the Web3 rabbit hole to find a new solution. \n Our focus is on building coordination software for the future of work, conducting applied research experiments with DAOs, and perpetuating decentralized work culture through art, media, education, and events.\n\nAt talentDAO we are studying layer zero and building human coordination experiments so that we might all benefit. In simplest terms, we are using science to fix DAOs and DAOs to fix science. To do this well will only be possible if science is given an infrastructure and culture upgrade. This is where we come in. \n\nZooming out\n\n \n\nDAOs create opportunities for global impact. Human coordination structures of this scale have never been available to solve challenges in scientific innovation until now. Over the next 20 years entire communities of scientists will organize using DAO structures. A digital nation of scientists operating as a DAO will dramatically improve the probability of achieving important sustainability goals mandated by the United Nations. We focus on four of them. \n\n \n\nGoal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\n\nEveryone should have access to decentralized working arrangements. To see that through, we\u2019re building the foundations required for a decentralized work economy starting with the talentDAO community. Our goal is to have the majority of members who wish to be bankless and self-sovereign workers a reality by 2030. Everyone should have the right to decent work, free from affliction and labor exploitation.\n \n\nGoal 9: Build infrastructure and foster innovation\n\nThe traditional academic process has stifled innovation. The scientific record of knowledge is vulnerable to the risks of centralized Web2 storage. TalentDAO is building all of its research on a completely decentralized publication that is censorship resistant, immutable, and safely secured on Arweave. We are fostering innovation by allowing for a bottom up approach to research by creating an open social graph of scientists built on Lens Protocol. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal 10: Reduce Inequality\n\nEnsuring funding and educational resources are provided to all students across the world, not just the weird ones. Contributing to open source research that is accessible to all and with no paywall required. Traditional research publications systematically discriminate against students with less access to education resources. \n \n\nGoal 11: Sustainable cities and communities\n\n \n\nIn the future DAOs will be sovereign digital nations. At talentDAO, we aspire to create a Network State of interdisciplinary educational institutes, providing high quality education and research to all parts of the world, not just the privileged. We cannot go at this alone. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve teamed up with groups such as CityDAO and Sapien Network to scale together.\n\n\nWhat we are building\n\n \n\nWeb3 solutions for scientific peer review, funding, and publication. Making it easy for any education program to launch a journal and sub-DAO.\n\n \n\nOur first solution is a framework for a peer reviewed journal publication and open science social graph with native DAO governance on-chain integrated. We are building research primitives and governance technologies to help onboard the next 1000 web3 enabled research sub-DAOs.  \n\nHow we educate and advocate\n\n \n\nProducts take time but our mission can\u2019t wait. That\u2019s why we began creating original applied research from day one. Several emergent research projects have formed that are entirely driven by community participation and championed by a talentDAO researcher. We do our best to provide resources to these groups and onboard more students to help create new ones.\n\n1. DAO Leadership: Sharing leadership is a key tenet of DAOs. Yet distributing leadership across members of a community is easier said than done: there are several instances of centralized leadership within the web3 ecosystem. For this reason we set out to study leadership in the decentralized world of work.\n\nOur researchers are the heart of talentDAO, and in 2022 we saw the Research Guild come to life.\n\nWe are proud to share with you a list of 8 projects that we\u2019ve been working on with our different community-operated teams. This is a summary of our milestones and things we will be working on during 2023, which promises to be an exciting year for the Research Guild. \n\n\n1) Network health survey\nIn decentralized organizations, we have the opportunity to analyze more data than ever before. Governance processes and other on-chain activity is made publicly available thanks to the blockchain and off-chain communication data is accessible through various API services. For example, both Discord and Discourse offer public APIs for data extraction.\n\nBut communication and on-chain activity still do not tell the complete picture of what is happening under the hood. We must also extract data on the psychosocial properties of the organization in order to have a complete understanding of the health of a DAO. To do so, our team has designed a survey that will collect the data necessary to understand the health of organizations so DAO leaders can take action to improve the experience of contributors. Learn more about our process of designing this survey and the theoretical discussion here.\n\nWe will be launching a series of organizational assessment pilot studies in 2023 with DAOs who want to use science-backed tooling to assess their community health. Survey participants will have access to a non-transferable proof of completion NFT made claimable at the end of the survey which will unlock access to future perks and drops. Survey participants will also have the option to opt into our data-sharing program and earn a share of transaction fees generated from our Data NFTs minted on Ocean Marketplace.\n\n2) Project L.I.O.N.\nL.I.O.N: Language Informatics on Organizational Networks\n\nProject LION is a joint DAO effort from talentDAO and LabDAO to build natural language processing systems for analyzing and maintaining community health.\n\nFor DAOs specifically, transaction data can provide insight into on-chain governance operations and degrees of decentralization. However, many DAO operations occur off-chain in the form of relational data. And there is a particular piece of information that is both deeply insightful and stored off-chain: communication.\n\nThis is a software project that will build a tool that will allow us to do research. It is in the development stage and the team is raising funds on Gitcoin. Be sure to check out their grant page if you are as excited about this project as we are. The project roadmap write-up can be found here.\n\n3) Decentralized Leadership\n\u201cDAOs don\u2019t have hierarchies\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have a boss\u201d \u201cDaos are leaderless\u201d\n\n-Is that so?\n\nAt talentDAO, we believe that leadership emerges naturally in any human organization. DAOs are no exception to this, so we decided to study how leadership works in a decentralized space. We began with an extensive literature review on organizational leadership where we covered the last 25+ years of academic research.\n\nThen we moved on to interview leaders from all over the world who work in different DAOs. We talked with more than 20 founders, core members, contributors with long experience in the space, and mentors. All that information is currently being qualitatively analyzed by our team, and we will present the results at ETHDenver and in a future publication.\n\nExpect early research results to be communicated in January 2023. A series of educational workshops, leadership coaching tools, and training seminars will be designed based on the findings of our research on Decentralized Leadership.\n\n4) Onboarding\nOne of the main pain points that DAOs suffer is trying to get a smooth onboarding experience that allows them to get and retain new members. Our team is working on a multi-phase study that aims to know more about the different strategies that the DAO ecosystem has to onboard new people, so we can identify best practices and strategies that suit the different kinds of DAOs. During 2022 the team focused on a literature review to examine existing frameworks to evaluate onboarding experiences (or induction processes, as traditional organizations call them). After that, those frameworks were adapted to the requirements of DAOs and now are ready to be tested in 2023.\n\nIn the coming months, phase 1 will be launched with the recruitment of mystery shoppers that will join different DAOs to experience their onboarding process. We will then evaluate this through ethnographic observations and surveys made with the frameworks we discovered through the literature review. Review more of the project deliverables on the team\u2019s Notion page. \n\n5) DAOversity\nThis study is a collaboration with BanklessDAO where we made a survey asking questions about inclusivity and underrepresented groups, so we could know if members felt comfortable in their space. This is a qualitative confidential study and we managed to collect more than 150 surveys. Right now we are preparing to analyze these responses so we can share the results with the broader community. We are eager to discuss these results to keep debating about people feeling included in DAOs and how we can improve their experiences.\n\n6) Discourse Knowledge Graph\nSo many DAO communities rely on Discourse to host their online forum discussions. These forum discussions are often focused on topics related to changes in the DAO\u2019s protocol or improvements in governance. For a data scientist, the Discourse knowledge base is a treasure trove of data. So why not study it to understand the meta-science of DAO governance? This study seeks to do just that. \n\nWhile the study is in its infancy it has quickly garnered interest within the talentDAO research community. Several data scientists have quickly volunteered to develop a proof of concept of a sensing tool that uses NLP to analyze topics.\n\nCheck out the research proposal cross-posted on the Smart Contract Research Forum to learn more about future directions: research forum post\n\nFor the DAO hackers out there the data notebook has been made public to explore the NLP models being used.\n\n7) Compensation\nAt talentDAO, we conducted a survey investigating the relationship between different compensation structures and contributors\u2019 attitudes like motivation, satisfaction, commitment, and fairness perceptions. Using an experimental vignette study we wanted to understand if certain DAO compensation strategies resulted in more favorable perceptions of organizational justice. The four incentive strategies studied were bounties, Coordinape, hourly payment, and salary. Not surprisingly, salary was viewed as the fairest payment method. Study participants vocalized pay stability as an important factor when determining if they perceived a work environment as fair. Very interestingly, as the DAO community size grew bounty systems were progressively viewed as less favorable. We believe these findings will help inform future DAO compensation design in the tooling space.\n\nThis project was a joint effort with BanklessDAO where we collected 166 respondents. Read more about the full study here: DAO Compensation study\n\nIn 2023 the team aims to do more analysis of this data and then present a written document to share with the community. We also plan to have several open working sessions and webinars related to DAO compensation.\n\n8) DAO Structure & Design study\nThe core objective of the DAO Structure & Design project is to create a well-researched body of knowledge about DAO structures and design. It is not an audit project about what exists, but more about how effective and impactful DAO structures should look like. This body of knowledge will be published so the broader community can discuss the results and make use of these insights.\n\nRight now the team is finishing the literature review so they can move on to do structure analysis and interviews with DAO cartographers (those who map the organizational chart of the DAO) in Q1 2023. After that, the project will move on to Stage 2 to do in-depth interviews with builders, community managers, and experts in the DAO ecosystem to ask about organizational structures in web3 and to see what works and what doesn\u2019t from their perspective.\n", "website": "https://talentdao.io", "bannerImg": "bafybeietmnwfnfrnxyetclvnncjetanm7x4p62qtrivquxejvuoihund5m", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreihneryzo26ihiycqbl6nrgaeycucnreyjva4axicct6sb5rgggbsi"}, "userGithub": "", "projectGithub": "https://github.com/Talent-DAO", "projectTwitter": "talentdao_", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "jYF6/aI2crn7zbwYPu/JeYj6bP0Pzxg8f47/aJOeDhJFBSdhH9rOMNEW5ezLnIMz", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "92aa596d79b581f1af1ac5665a33f5efd82315c1424f58f7e33b9880291c3b02bf0dfa16240ba61703fc36fb0f163e1525354d912f797c2b0f955b93bba98ad4ff3c502a04c63b5ab8a22b402ad761e487129bc642a8c23ba98bd6ccb3bf82a167ac2dd01dce57a0e133c9a3861327a2eaa41c48e16a959458aed981571795990000000000000020ccefab9a7887448c20df657a386db712da970a16dbe449889daaa151292edb33c58f9178bf098de2cd79b3f9b3cfb1aa"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Gitcoin Grants, Ocean Protocol Grants, SCRF, Arweave Grant, bootstrap"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "15"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/Talent-DAO"}]}}}, {"id": "0x60c037f9dfa5daee0f07bc26fb73393ef924e36c73c41ea6bd58029e1724de36-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0x60c037f9dfa5daee0f07bc26fb73393ef924e36c73c41ea6bd58029e1724de36", "status": "APPROVED", "payoutAddress": "0x18aa467E40E1deFB1956708830A343c1D01d3D7C", "createdAt": "1673941667", "updatedAt": "1673941667", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreidpoxv3b4ers27i6vmte3dsiixcwafonukizcwfml3jdjhya4nhai"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x57555ed0d1f3a8ef880432e6be3b788348020c10afbfad62047c0014aacee05e0a063fe4e3d71a811bff0d05aa5e8091026c6eaf7125cfaf4ff923db1f6b61ec1c", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x18aa467E40E1deFB1956708830A343c1D01d3D7C", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673940899264, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:240", "title": "JediSwap", "description": "Note: Donations for this grant are for development only.

Mesh has developed a system to measure all kinds of contributions, including development, design, community management, growth, etc. Compared to most DAOs, Mesh is not just decentralizing governance but enabling operations and execution in a community-driven way.\n\n\n\nWhat is different?\nThe Mesh community believes that billions of people will come to crypto-only if it is cheap, secure, and easy to use.\n\nCheap - JediSwap will be one of the 1st gasless dapp on StarkNet.\n\nSecure - Thanks to StarkNet, JediSwap leverages the security of Ethereum. Users never rely on multisig bridges to leverage a cheaper and scalable ecosystem.\n\nSimplicity - JediSwap believes in simplicity both for users and builders. Users can swap or earn by adding liquidity in one single click. By keeping the simplicity rule on the smart contracts level, JediSwap also enables devs to build many different kinds of applications, which was impossible on L1s before. There are already 25+ teams building on top of JediSwap. These applications include creating on-chain games, metaverse projects, cross-chain apps, aggregators, and furucombo style dapps.\n\nCommunity - There is not a single employee at JediSwap, and everything is done by the community.\n\n\n\nWhy Validity Rollups (aka ZKRollups) and StarkNet?\nThe next wave of crypto will come for various non-financial applications like gaming. As a result, there will be a 100x number of tokens launching on scalable L2s instead of L1s. These users will prefer the cheapest tx and the most uncomplicated applications that are easy to understand and use. The Mesh community believes StarkNet is a front-runner in the Validity Rollup (also known as ZKRollup) ecosystem. The mesh community has been building on StarkNet since October 2021 and has seen a 20x increase in the number of builders building on StarkNet.\n\n\n\nWhat else is special?\nWhile building JediSwap, the Mesh community is publishing many public goods. Some of the published public goods include\n\nStarkNet React library - it saves hours of work for any builder building a frontend app on StarkNet\n\nBase64 encoding in Cairo - a primitive which can make generative art possible on Starknet\n\nDeFi Pooling(coming soon) - Enabling access to L1 apps by batching txs on StarkNet\n\nDAO tools and frameworks: \n- Ability to give Discord/Twitter contributors tokens/NFTs while preserving the privacy\n- An alert bot for Discord communities and contributors to make coordination easy\n\n\n\nRoadmap:\nCurrent:\nMainnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet mainnet on 30th Nov 2022, and 10000+ users have used JediSwap since then.\n\nTestnet - JediSwap launched on StarkNet testnet on Jan 2022 and 150,000+ user have used the JediSwap on testnet since then.\n\nNext 3 months:\nIntegrations - focus on building integrations with 50+ dapps\nLaunch DeFi Pooling as a public good\nOnchain contributor profile\nProductionize DAO tools to make them usable by any community\n\n", "website": "https://jediswap.xyz", "bannerImg": "bafybeihfw2iiogtgc2vfhgk2zkiaolyh6fhql7s437eblx7ta7vepme6m4", "logoImg": "bafybeiei72o7yjtpvce5ldpmjcrdcpnbi67jabs77hjveo6xggvfmwc3cm", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreiatqdr7zythvghmiol6b3ety2rpzohg53map3lss3ccwwn2wedtti"}, "userGithub": "jediswapintern", "projectGithub": "jediswaplabs", "projectTwitter": "jediswap", "credentials": {"twitter": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xeD0087B28b00B92C5c7767B1dDaB3095762150CF", "hash": "v0.0.0:bc16HDIvUWUoewNWo93POqSRmvLZzpNVdF8qZ7tV+DY=", "provider": "ClearTextTwitter#JediSwap", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}]}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-17T07:34:00.171Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-17T07:34:00.172Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..yJgRfGfWIoMISk79jejXpip-DmfNdJxX_BVmHT-0g57cz-HJ50c8MiNjPUZwMy_J2clpxcxz4oNYAdQBYJjoDg"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-17T07:34:00.171Z"}}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "iadZgFAWDgF0gy/ipDaLfuQ6mit9dKWMuo3ov2d5N+COgXus2IR2A/njmOLsav1/", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "484abcabc18aac19b9883b3fda61969610b58cb1e80fc36cbc37d2e2c89c4d4c8fadf06f38cd2bb0deb569ea30e1e21790106fac06899d418427a0dea465915ee542fb6bedfaa03d27c0074043339f4a2faadaddcb2600710928d1424c0cf7901d007181c4acd75b58752846722ca9c1c4e302bc2b62f04c663a7180f593762c0000000000000020cd0f44238bd265e481073a76d13977bd81ed8915d51eb737ee8ff93798729bfe033ebacae5f6c38fcedc9599f7caaab0"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Gitcoin grant mainly.

For example, when you pick up a book in an antique bookstore, and you want to \"steal\" some words from it before you take it home.\n\nThe text is generated under the user's own DID signature, while data is stored on a distributed content storage network--IPFS to enable public search.\n\n- Wordblock.xyz - a global text block search engine\n\nAll the word blocks created will be pooled in one place for public search, or later public reference.\n\nFor example, you can process public block searches via tags, keywords, or user DID\n\nCompared with local storage note-taking tools like obsidian or central storage Roamresearch, the difference is in data storage in order to achieve public block search.\n\n- Use cases\n\n1) A social graph\nAfter collecting those text blocks, it is easy to form P2P social relations*(e.g. walletChat)* via tag matching.\n\n2) A decentralized multi-lingual literature library\nThe inspiration is when I visited an ancient Malatestiana library (the 1st public library in human history) in Cesena, Italy.\n\nEach codex is tied to the desk with a root ironed chain, so that precise objects could not be stolen, it is now a symbol of the arts of literature, copies include 20 years italian, french and german s copy by using humane scripture called \"literature antiqua\", text includes classical latin authors, churchenergy , greek\u2026\n\nIt's like a warm salute from afar history that tells how humans keep words and knowledge. In the context of today, we stand a chance to \"chain text\" differently and interestingly with technology.\n\nToday, we care less about \"preventing books from being stolen\" but about \"HOW things are connected\", so the desire to build a distributed literature dictionary(library) where people from anywhere in the world could contribute their input even in different languages.\n\nFor example, after I read the Chinese version of\u300aMr.Gywn\u300b, I para-read the original Italian version, then build the connections in between. It is one of the very fun techniques for acquiring a second language through intertextuality, while also a way to let the machine know how people from different linguistic computing systems tell the SAME story.\n\nRead more: https://mirror.xyz/0x65a0Af703047dfDd270361659d02f4f0E8547202/YmbixVzwGJ0l46X6PDtVBbYY64Jd-SfRSD8usBZUzno\n\n3) A data graph\nwe are in the early stage of defining data as an asset with maturing infrastructure like IPFS, Ceramic network, dataverseOS etc, the excitement of web3 is the data as streams that can be visualized and later used by individuals. We could first collect those fragmented attentions \ud83d\udc40 with ease, and then browse/ the data, or re-organize(reference) with personal signature.\n\n- Tech\n\n1) Ceramic Streams\nWordblock uses Ceramic Stream to store the JSON metadata of a block. Metadata includes BlockID, Creation Date, Source URL, Author, Tags, Type, and Content. The DID of the user submitting the block to the Ceramic network is also bound to the metadata. The Wordblock data model can be shared between anplications on the Ceramic network.\n\n2) web3.storage\nWordblock uses web3.storage for data backup and permanent storage.

Every ENS user can receive a notification if it happened to their name. \n\n\nThe problem\n\nNames in the Ethereum Name Service are unique, but there are no restrictions on registering look-alike names that are visually very difficult to distinguish from genuine ones. For example, having a name vitalik.eth, an attacker can register a similar name by replacing the symbol lowercase L with uppercase i: vitaIik.eth. The name is visually similar, but it is treated by the protocol as a completely different name, with its own hash, as well as an address bound to it. \n\nThis type of attack is called a homograph attack. Regarding the ENS protocol, it can be performed in the following ways:\n- Substitution of character pairs i/I, i/j, O/0, w/vv, m/rn, etc., which depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish;\n- Replacing ASCII characters with visually similar ones from Unicode; for example, \u201cfa\u0441eboo\u0441k.eth\u201d uses the letters o and \u0441 from Cyrillic;\n- Use of invisible Unicode symbols; \n- Spoofing using uppercase letters; for example, bitcoin.eth may be spoofed as Bitcoin.eth. \n\nENS fights this attack pretty hard by normalizing names before they are registered, as well as warning against using non-ascii characters on its site. However, to save gas, such checks have been implemented off-chain, on the frontend side. Any user can register a name bypassing the official site by calling the protocol contract directly.\n\n\nThe solution\n\nDevelop a Forta bot that monitors on-chain contract events responsible for registering \".eth\" names. As soon as the bot detects a new registered name, it tries to normalize it and checks if a similar name has already been registered. If so, the bot fires an alert specifying the registered name, the existing normalized name, and the addresses of the accounts to which these names are bound.\n\nForta Protocol allows each user to subscribe to alerts involving their addresses, so if their name is spoofed, they will immediately receive a notification in one of the convenient ways: Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack or Webhook.\n\nIn addition, when combined with bots that detect subsequent stages of suspicious activity, we will have enough evidence to claim a scam attack. For example, the next follow-up checks could be obtaining tokens, selling them, and laundering funds through services like Tornado Cash. \n\nAs a result, the Forta ENS Spoofing Bot will play an important role in detecting scam attacks, maximizing the chances of their detection.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 19 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.", "website": "https://github.com/kovart/forta-ens-spoofing", "bannerImg":

Our mission is to bring more women to Web3 and ensure they help build the future of the internet.\n\nThe Challenge\nLess than 5% of crypto entrepreneurs are women. We are here to change that through education, empowerment and job opportunities. \n\nOur Solutions\nWe develop educational solutions for women, newcomers, and organizations, providing them with the knowledge and skills to unlock Web3\u2019s potential and drive innovation.\n\n1. Surge Web3 Content Hub\nThe Surge Web3 Content Hub is an open-sourced space for easily digestible Web3 educational content, focusing on simplifying the technical and social impacts of blockchain. \n\nWe have over 45 articles on blockchain basics, investment best practices, NFTs, cryptocurrencies, articles for devs, and others. Additionally, we\u2019ve gamified our content with interactive quizzes, a fun crypto dictionary, and several articles translated to Spanish for our Hispanic community.\n\n2. Surge Weekly Newsletter\nWe deliver a free weekly newsletter breaking down complex topics, cutting through the noise, and delivering summarized crypto news for our users to stay up-to-date. \n\n3. Surge Passport NFT\nWith the mission of onboarding women into the Web3 industry, we launched the Surge Passport NFT: a golden ticket into the crypto space, offering opportunities, early access, and discounts to token-holders through a one-time purchase.\n\nSold out in less than a week, the Surge Passport is a collection of 5,000 hand-drawn NFTs generated through our custom-built generative art algorithm. Since launch, we have built a community of over 2.5K unique owners who have claimed thousands of dollars in value through their Surge Passport NFT.\n\nAdditionally, because we experienced the difficulties of building and launching an NFT project ourselves, we have spent the last year publishing resources to making the process a lot friendlier. We have created articles describing NFT smart contract development, how to build generative art algorithms, how to market in the web3 space, how to build community, among others.\n\n4. A Web3 Infrastructure Course\nAfter researching our community, we realized many are craving a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology works under the hood. That is why we created the \u201cWeb3 Stack - Crypto Infrastructure Behind the Scenes\u201d course. \n\nThis course is specially designed for people working in non-technical Web3 roles, as well as Web2 engineers looking to understand the Web3 infrastructure deeper to make the leap. Students walk away with a firm grasp of blockchain technology so they can excel in their Web3 career. \n\n5. Surge Jobs Board\nOur Web3 Jobs Board pairs 250+ vetted female talent with some of the industry\u2019s top organizations looking to diversify their teams. This is a key part of our vision in securing women\u2019s place within Web3, as we provide organizations with hiring opportunities directly from the talent we\u2019re seeing rise in our community.\n\n6. A vibrant and supportive Discord community\nConnecting women and non-binary individuals in real-time, our 8k+ Discord community is filled with newcomers and experts who support one another through our crypto learning journey. Strategically built to be a friendly, welcoming and inclusive environment, this is the digital home for the Surge community to run initiatives, share insights, and collaborate synchronously.\n\nThe Future of Surge\nWe\u2019re laser-focused on bringing more community initiatives to life and providing even more value to those who have trusted us with this mission.\n\nAlongside our many initiatives - like ecosystem research, Twitter Spaces, articles, investments, and community projects - we will now be heavily invested in developing open-source educational content for individuals and organizations to learn and scale up their Web3 capabilities. We invite anyone who shares our mission, including our male allies, to join us in making this possible.\n\nProviding free, easy-to-understand educational content is a huge challenge to solve, but we are confident that with the right resources and like-minded individuals, there\u2019s a lot more we can do to solve this imbalance!\n\n**Support us and help us secure women's place in Web3.

Throughout the manual, users are encouraged to complete exercises that ensure they engage with the foundational building blocks of zk-SNARKs. While doing that, readers build the smallest possible \u2014 but fully functional \u2014 cryptographic stack to compute zk-SNARK internals without the need of a computer.\n\nAs users go through the manual, they will grasp mathematical concepts that are not only used in SNARKs, but also in other zero-knowledge proofs and cryptography more generally.", "website": "https://leastauthority.com/community-matters/moonmath-manual/", "bannerImg": "bafybeift25qgrwazy7vkobmsm3n2bwlswtcivtoadvfojcceluxobqwskm", "logoImg": "bafkreifj2gcizc2756enj22latephx2wo7p5go4wzxonnvzrzwp6eb5tcy", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreiaa5wks5hpq4ywkfx6464pghtaf7zxsdhdxi4j2ubxxudlu5rp5ei"}, "userGithub": "Liz315", "projectGithub": "LeastAuthority", "projectTwitter": "LeastAuthority", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "Mmlt9Wa+TIupepReLGIeIM5NF8FMcUC33h2dhX9+yFxoAWoN24KUb4I5/DqKkb01", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "37a024df4434219a8897a1db9cf72b14555ce222853aa9bded3f80f73d67f628952c3ad1a4c68b2a094ce39ce5b78111b567f2c141a9af7d45d8e17b99569b3cd03447866b7fa3ec446043ca956107c7280eb0e0c09fa81f4eaffff5213864b8e5f0de262a92e2ba0e241e520c81ca21cb6c0dde9182bf65c89c0ebcbb896aad0000000000000020a1627f42b0c3ab2b661769cdce8b421d1a7059730234449f92e1d8cf605347c3c780d11fa110d6fdaa5076d1c41d838f"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Least Authority TFA GmbH, Gitcoin"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "5"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "No and No"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/Liz315,  https://github.com/LeastAuthority"}]}}}, {"id": "0x79f3e178005bfbe0a3defff8693009bb12e58102763501e52995162820ae3560-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0x79f3e178005bfbe0a3defff8693009bb12e58102763501e52995162820ae3560", "status": "REJECTED", "payoutAddress": "0x7b736FE138775D1fCD2CFE4E1D6158BfF3a2F28e", "createdAt": "1673816267", "updatedAt": "1673816267", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreihmiixupx3kfpavzxitbq7avtd22zllawvhgkto42utnipgr4yjva"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0xd310934f58c0f87da7251b9b43bacf59e304118a482f044fd0845e04117f15db4473be9d53161926314ff1d580d61729d9755f0c80021630fb4297091565a0731b", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x7b736FE138775D1fCD2CFE4E1D6158BfF3a2F28e", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673815725545, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:213", "title": "Forta Bots: Funding & Money Laundering Through Aztec Protocol", "description": "Most attacks begin and end with the use of private services that allow funding or withdrawals without revealing the sender and recipient. \n\nThe most popular service among attackers of DeFi projects was the Tornado Cash mixer. However, after it was blocked by The US Department of Treasury, other projects will likely take over this niche. Aztec Protocol, which is a privacy-first zk-rollup on Ethereum, could be a potential such project. \n\nProject goal\n\nTo improve attack detection in the Forta Protocol ecosystem, develop two separate bots  to cover both the account funding stage before an attack and the money laundering stage that occurs after the attack is performed.\n\nFunded Account Interaction Bot\n\nThis bot detects when an account that was funded by Aztec Connect interacts with a contract.\n\nThe severity of these findings is low, as they do not indicate malicious activity. However, in the presence of other suspicious activity, they greatly increase the accuracy of attack detection.\n\nMoney Laundering Bot\n\nThis bot detects when numerous large transfers are made to Aztec Connect, potentially indicating post-hacking money laundering activity. All user transfers are summed up within a specified time and checked for exceeding the threshold. The severity of such findings is high.\n\nThese bots will work similarly to existing bots for Tornado Cash, and I'm sure they will be able to increase the accuracy as well as the number of detected attacks. \n\nAbout the Author\n\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community.

In this way, they finance the first steps of the team, their promotion and entry into the cryptocurrency market. However, it is worth noting that not every team manages to go through all the stages of project formation and success. Possible technical and organizational moments that happen or become impossible for the further development of the project. Nevertheless, early investors still purchase tokens for new projects.\n\n\n\n  Participation in tokenseals has become quite popular in recent years. This is due to the fact that consumers expect to sell the acquired crypto-assets worthy of attention after they are released on exchanges. This is one of the options for getting \"X's\" in cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n  The tokenomics of a cryptoproject should be studied before deciding to invest in a particular project. It can help determine how balanced the current economic model is, and understand if the investment data will be profitable. In addition to this, there are several other things to consider:\n\nExperienced investors always carefully and thoroughly disclose the tokenomics of a project before investing.\nIn order to avoid early sale of project tokens by early investors, the project's tokenomics includes a blocking token to classify contagion cases.\nEach consumption category has its own token unlocking schedule (vesting), which gives when and in what state an investor receives tokens and sells them.\nFor development, the token unlocking schedule helps predict token selling pressure and find reasonable entry points into the project (when token unlocking is due, selling pressure, which causes the token price to drop).\n\n\nThe project was created with full enthusiasm.

network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time.\n\nUnderlying Forta is a decentralized network of independent node operators that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.\n\n\n\n## What is this agent\n\nAfter the sanction of Tornado Cash, many attackers move to other services to launder their money. Umbra Protocol is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum, meaning it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh address, which is controlled by the intended receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that. Although technically speaking Umbra Protocol is not a mixer, its privacy protection feature makes it seem to be an alternative to Tornado Cash. Consequently, this agent will be built to monitor transfers related to Umbra Protocol, and hopefully, we can link the sender and receiver accurately based on its working principle.", "website":

This would be beneficial to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. If there was a system of voting contracts covering a wide range of possible voting types from token-weighted voting via quadratic voting to delegation, then DAOs could simply plug in rather than hard-coding yet another, say, token-weighted voting into their contracts. Plugging in would be as simple as pointing to a deployed voting contract. One can also plug out or exchange the reference from one voting contract to another.\n\nWe have deployed a registry contract to polygon and mainnet (https://etherscan.io/address/0xC535389b5a26efEbc27811915B6d78f6C95433f7) and opened a topic on the Ethereum magicians forum to discuss the EIP draft: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-draft-configurable-voting-contract/10736 \n\nI am currently developing a dapp that lets people interact with a playground, where one can plug in and out of voting contracts and get a feeling for the framework. This site is hosted on ipfs and served through ens: https://votingcontracts.eth.limo/. The development of this app and the deployment of the underlying playground and pluggable voting contracts to ethereum mainnet are the next steps. Feedback is very welcome. Please do reach out with feature requests and ideas. There is also a node package: @leomarlo/voting-registry-contracts, though I am considering migrating that at some point. There are two repositories for this project: https://github.com/leomarlo/voting-contracts-frontend and https://github.com/leomarlo/voting-registry-contracts . \n\n**Updates will appear here!**",

Umbra----\n\nAs a protocol, Umbra defines a simple set of standards, coupled with a singleton smart contract instance, to enable stealth addresses on Ethereum. With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is. \n\nOn chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they\u2019ve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.\n\nBy leveraging meta-transactions Umbra enables withdrawers to pay relayers for gas using the tokens they\u2019ve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing.\n\n----Project Status----\n\nThe Umbra MVP went live in June 2021. You can visit https://app.umbra.cash to send and receive stealth payments using Umbra.\n\nSince our launch, we've made many iterative improvements based on user feedback. These included better mobile responsiveness, a simpler key registry system, faster scanning when searching for received funds, and other UX enhancements. We've also launched Umbra on Polygon, Optimism, and Umbra, and made huge improvements to our relay system to make token withdrawals faster and cheaper.\n\nSince launch, Umbra has processed nearly 100,000 payments across all networks,  transacting more than $50 Million in value in the process. More than 52,000 accounts have registered stealth keys to enable privacy preserving payments through Umbra. Despite this growth, Umbra remains a grant funded public good project made possible by the community.\n\n---- What's Next----\n\nWe are grateful to our many supporters who have enabled us to get this far. There's still lot's more work to do!\n\nWe believe there is so much more we can do to make Umbra an even more powerful privacy tool in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the year ahead, we're focused on continuing to improve Umbra through withdrawal integrations, new network deployments, performance improvements, and host of small UX improvements and features.

Orgassign designed an all-in-one tool that fixed these pain points. It doesn\u2019t bombard you with notifications like Discord, its token-gated permissions are simpler than both Notion and Google Docs, and unlike Github, it\u2019s also designed for non-technical contributors. \u200d\n\n\n\nOrgassign helps contributors increase their efficiency by tracking tasks and goals while also providing a lasting, single point-of-reference so everyone knows what\u2019s being worked on(and why). It manages to do all this with a tidy,intuitive interface.\n\n\n\nOrgassign is a shared contribution space with different sections:\n\n\n\nRoadmap - with goals, projects and tasks showing how everything fits together. Contributors are able to see a clear line between the organization\u2019s overall goal, their team\u2019s efforts, and their individual assignments.\n\n\nWiki - is where important information that has more permanence lives. Notes can be added to the wiki using hashtags as you are working on projects, so knowledge management is not a separate task but part of the workflow.\n\n\nGroups and roles - manages what individuals can see and contribute to, which can be done through token-gating.\n\n\nconclusion\n\n\nUltimately, Orgassign is designed to help you work in quite a specific way, making sure plans and tasks add up into an overarching vision(OKR style), and integrating documentation with task management. This is well-suited for DAOs because it retains historical knowledge that would otherwise be lost if individual contributors moved on, a common occurrence in the space.\n\n", "website":

This will only compound with the adoption of augmented reality smart glasses and other always-on wearables/embeddables. The foundations of our lived reality shouldn\u2019t be defined by arbitrary app store rules and the subversive, never-ending drive for corporate profit growth.\n\nWe\u2019re building the Geo Web because we think the metaverse should be based on permissionless, public internet infrastructure. It should be an extension of the ethos/design of the internet, the early web, and Ethereum.\n\nThe Geo Web is divided into digital land parcel NFTs which map 1:1 to the physical world. The market for digital land is administered under a partial common ownership (aka Harberger tax) system. Digital content can be anchored to the land utilizing our p2p content layer (Ceramic, IPFS, & Filecoin).\n\nThe Geo Web is a fair, efficient, and legitimate way to bootstrap and scale the metaverse across our shared planet. \n\nBy reinvesting 100% of land market proceeds into rewarding open-source developers, creatives, advocates, users, and public goods, we can create compounding network utility and value. The Geo Web is a choice for positive-sum coordination over fixed-mindset tradition.\n\nIf the Geo Web is successful, we can help spur the adoption of partial common ownership systems beyond our network and help redefine global property rights systems to be fairer and more efficient.\n-\nUpdate Since GR15\n- \nThe Geo Web launched on Optimism with a fair launch auction on December 15th, 2022! You can claim a parcel at your home, business, or favorite public place now at https://geoweb.land/.  \n\nThis project has been a labor of love for over two years. We couldn't be more excited to be live and thankful for the support of all the Gitcoin contributors that empowered us to make it here.\n-\nPlans for Alpha Round Funding\n-\nWith the Geo Web platform/economic system live, the core team is shifting focus to building and supporting use cases with partners, builders, and creators. \n\nFunds received from this QF round will primarily be distributed to core team members and open source contributors through Coordinape Circles and/or Govrn's DAO contributor platform as we maintain that use case focus.  We may allocate some of the funds to bounties on Dework and incidental costs of development/tooling/hosting use cases as well.\n\nThese funds will help bridge the core team until the Geo Web digital land market produces enough revenue to fund its own QF rounds (https://docs.geoweb.network/community-and-governance/network-funds-allocation). \n-\nLinks\n-\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/sbqWRGhb\nCadastre - https://geoweb.land/\nSpatial Browser - https://geoweb.app/\nWebsite - https://geoweb.network/\nGithub - https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project\nDework Bounties - https://app.dework.xyz/geo-web\nForum - https://forum.geoweb.network/\nDocs - https://docs.geoweb.network/\nTwitter - @thegeoweb\nNewsletter Signup - https://bit.ly/geowebsignup\nBlog - https://geoweb.network/blog\n", "website": "https://geoweb.land/", "bannerImg": "bafkreib6vcpfk6ri26t6h7gbixq4kw5hx7zzwrh7ne2cc3wmkrchgcmwgq", "logoImg": "bafkreifl3ynwvpodxcxoj2duwqcxjawgmsryxsz3kpe4cme3i5xqgwv4jq", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreiblyg45yvfp7eeyzyo34qvetcxbca6o67alsunvngyupozomxht4a"}, "userGithub": "gravenp", "projectGithub": "Geo-Web-Project", "projectTwitter": "thegeoweb", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "49Qtlkp6AFYugCivxmo1sHJPp6tHC7ntIgxMGxxO/u/jJB/bNYeOWABMhquVHHiV", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "8f378f322ee0caa76cab219a5ecc2f71081968816752f0e28c1e3bc7bdc6281deee737de9677da31a85b3fce511a830b3b2488af39a77552c9ccd89d8ab5784c37d3d6d672ea872ed481946d088749c98af5edb9f49287e12d50e7ab94c4f2b9d0b8fb1a94f2a35c1b31f877c65ef71f5dccd1f38ecfcd4103f974c7677808e40000000000000020bbdd8f6d833fff95bf87841fa190920ec9e71577d4e1bffceb58a2220f146f1c157843d52932a2295c533ecc89ab9582"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Open source grants, Gitcoin grants (no VC)"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "3"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/gravenp, https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project"}]}}}, {"id": "0xaf7e0ce22feb1fa64e405a2d29ad3b0ac9092730b0312bf587ba3a20953b9373-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0xaf7e0ce22feb1fa64e405a2d29ad3b0ac9092730b0312bf587ba3a20953b9373", "status": "PENDING", "payoutAddress": null, "createdAt": "1673165927", "updatedAt": "1673165927", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreiggmocrs2ehod7bg5sipwt7ciaktg4nw2zo3l6mrntqp3vancmzbq"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x5e20fc49441be4deb453aec1aad7801a18554ab5ec15d95570e72c987a7b460519e1e52da86adb0afcb935f4488b6c3ed776fabbb415fbcfee69624239d9329c1c", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0xD3b90AfCAcCF0A6913f47761894b2b03f212Fb6a", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673165617127, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:74", "title": "Impersonator", "description": "Impersonator allows you to Log-in to dapps as ANY Ethereum Address via WalletConnect, iFrame or Browser Extension.\n\n - No private keys are required\n- Connect address to DApps in \"watch-only\" mode\n- Works with all major EVM chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, and various testnets as well.\n- Easily input addresses via ENS\n- Dynamically switch connected address and network, after being connected to a dapp.\n- Transaction calldata generated from dapps is now visible on the UI\n- Tenderly can be used to simulate transactions from the impersonated address.

From de-fi to privacy protection, web3 is a place where workshop participants can find the tools they need to further practice self-sovereignty, self-determination and self-efficacy.\nThere are domestic violence resources to leave. There are escape plans.  There are advocates who will guide you through the court process.  These resources are stretched thin as paper and require call after call to access them.  You know who can\u2019t make call after call and get return calls?  Women who are living under the thumb of a domestic terrorist.   \nGetting away is a mother fucker.  It is dangerous.  It is TERRIFYING.   I know because I\u2019ve done it.  \nMy ex-husband tried to kill me by pushing me down a flight of stairs to a concrete floor in front of our 4 year old son.  \nMy daughter\u2019s father, a different man, dragged me out of bed by my hair, broke my finger, choked me, and squeezed my jaw so hard that I could barely open my mouth for 4 days.  While I was pregnant. When I finally got him out of my house and had a restraining order, I woke up to him standing over me as I slept after breaking into my house.  He was not arrested, despite the restraining order.\nTherapeutic art  has been one of the most powerful tools in our recovery.\nThere are countless recovery programs for abusers that are paid for by the government and usually court mandated.  There are endless free (and paid) recovery/rehab programs for addiction to alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling, and eating disorders.  There are many 12-step meetings daily, all across the US for these issues.   \nFor people who have experienced abuse, recovery programs are few, not well structured, and underfunded.  You often find people with good intentions running a circle of stories centered around the abuser (codependent behavior) that often turns into the suffering Olympics, rather than focusing on the woman, her progress, and her well-being.  \nTo be clear - abusers are 100% responsible for the abuse they dole out.  There is no BLAME to the person who is abused.  \nThat being said, getting and staying in an abusive relationship is the result of not having a clear sense of self and strong boundaries.  The red flags that typically occur long before abusers take things physical would end the relationship for people with healthy boundaries.  The problem with never having had any agency over yourself is that you don\u2019t understand that LEAVING is the correct response to abusive behavior or that you even have that as an option.  While ending the relationship and respecting yourself are exactly the right answer, no person alive can do those things if they don\u2019t know, really know, deep down, that they CAN and that they have an intrinsic power over their own life.  If you were raised, like I was, with zero autonomy, you simply have no idea about personal boundaries, let alone how they apply to you, and that someone that will hurt you will never just change their mind and stop hurting you.  \nThere is a glaring lack of help that teaches people how to move forward and into an identity away and apart from the negative pattern of abuse that is likely all they have ever known, either to work their way up to getting out of an abusive situation or to rebuild themselves after they have left.\nThis is the space we aim to fill.\n\nFunding will go toward:\nCurriculum development\nIn-person workshops for women and their children\nSpace and material costs for workshops\nFilming demos for online use\nCreating a web3 platform for managing the workshops and onboarding participants to web3 by helping them understand web3 better, get a digital wallet if they don\u2019t have one, helping them create an online collection of their work in the metaverse (using Unlock Protocol on Polygon) that is a representation of their progress throughout the workshop. They will ultimately end up with a history of their process from start to finish, a story of their healing.\n\nFuture Goals:\nAdditional curriculum material from a diverse group of artists - ongoing\nGain widespread adoption of the curriculum for use by domestic violence services and individuals nationwide\nCreate a variation of the curriculum to be used with kids as a DETERRENT to domestic violence\nBroaden the potential use to people who speak a wide range of languages beyond English\nAdditional goals will be added as they become clearer\n\nFounder Personal History\nI have been painting since 1995.  I am a self-taught artist, gathering information and skills from a few college classes, a handful of online classes, YouTube tutorials, extensive reading and art evaluation, and just DOING it.  Painting has been many things to me, but what is most relevant to this is that it has been therapy and life.  I believe that art in all its forms is one of the most powerful means of personal transformation and restoration that exists.  While my current art practice is primarily about bringing beauty and joy into a world that can be very harsh, I have used art to process grief, to build my sense of self, and to exorcise traumatic events and their memories.\nI started in oils and worked sporadically in that, aerosol,  and other mediums as a means of self- expression until 2010.  At that time, I began to use art to process trauma, specifically domestic violence and rape.  The art therapy techniques my son was taught at age 4,  after witnessing his father try to kill me, were essential to his recovery, and led me down this path.  I began working in acrylics/mixed media and found a magic I had previously only known through making music.  I have also worked in watercolors, primarily in 2011 and again in 2019, when we were in Morocco, during which time I created an entire body of work - 30+ pieces - over a 5 month period, and solidified my desire to move toward being a full-time artist.  \nIn the curriculum we are outlining, the most important thing is developing a sense of self and the absolute value of each individual\u2019s perspective, expression, taste, and message, all of which happens in the inner world..  Neil Gaiman said \u201cThe one thing that you have that nobody else has is you.  Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision.\u201d  In my opinion, sparking the imagination of the inner world of an individual and repeatedly affirming the value of their voice is one of the most revolutionary things you can do, especially for someone who is being, or has been oppressed.  What happens inside of us belongs only to us. \nIn my opinion, abstract and emotional expressionist art are a deeply impactful form of visual communication that allows both creator and viewer to be moved in profound ways. My degree is in Mass Communication and Journalism with a minor in Psychology which deeply informs my understanding of visual communication.  I have studied brain and behavior correlation and taken a deep dive into PTSD, trauma, and recovery from it. \nMy current work is an exploration of vibrant color, texture, shape, movement, and telling stories by imbuing the canvas with energy and emotion.\nThe largest history and all of my past and current work can be viewed on my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/iMaakeArt\nI am an expert in connecting seemingly divergent groups of people through art and music with a proven track record..  My career as a financial planner speaks to my ability to communicate complex ideas in an easily understandable way, to manage numerous relationships simultaneously, to network broadly, and to steward resources responsibly.  I am accustomed to floating between groups of vastly differing socio-economic and cultural situations with consideration for all and an eye to my own internalized biases.  I have taken several courses in Group Therapy and believe what I learned about group dynamics will be an asset.\nCurrently I am the owner of Sunshine Alchemists & Soap Co and Night Sun Candle Company in addition to being an artist.  We employ women coming out of domestic violence and give them flexibility and support to maintain financial solvency while continuing to be present for their children.   Receiving funding for this project will enable me to shift further into community healing and art and free up finances to hire more people at the shop.  \n I have lived a great deal of life, which has given me a tremendous amount of compassion.  My parents were Christian fundamentalist pastors with a church and school in Montana. Our family lived in the abandoned forest service building that also housed the church and school.  We showered at the Y across the street.  There was no real kitchen.  Our power was turned off regularly.  I know what it is to live out of a gym bag and rely on the kindness of others for food. I had my first job at 12, out of necessity, touching up frames in a factory. Thankfully, my path also led me to live in the Bay area, New York, here in New Mexico, and to spend time in New Orleans and Miami, with people from all over the world. \n I learned that how I was raised and what I thought was normal was far from it and that unlearning is an intentional process which is ongoing.  I have lived through\u2026 way too many violent incidents of varying natures, and as Lin-Manuel Miranda says, \u201cWrote my way out.\u201d \nCo-founder Personal History\nAs a woman who has had a long career in tech I\u2019m excited to be involved with a project that I feel will have a significant impact on bringing more DEI to the space. More importantly, it will have an impact on reducing the suffering caused by domestic violence and hopefully reduce the numbers by ending what can sometimes be generational patterns. \nI started my career more than 20 years ago when I graduated with a degree in computer science. Since then I have worked as a full-stack developer, architect, consultant, engineering lead at a successful startup and founder. I have the skills necessary to help bring organization and coordination to this project to ensure the funding received is used as efficiently as possible and to guide development on the web3 platform in a way that will see real results. \nI\u2019ve been involved in the web3 space since 2018, currently work for a web3 protocol, belong to many DAOs including several with a focus on DEI and serve on the board of advisors for multiple web3 companies.   \nDEI Round\nYou can find the statistics in our grant or on Google but it is widely known that historically disenfranchised groups of people, women, children, BIPOC and LGBTQA+ communities with fewer resources  are disproportionately affected by domestic violence. That is the community we will be serving with this program and that is the community we will be helping onboard to web3, thereby increasing diversity in the space. Additionally the current team, although small, is all female.\n\nEcosystem Round Tags\nUnlock\nAs part of the tools which will be built to enable the management of these workshops we will be building an open sourced art workshop platform (dApp). The platform itself will include the ability to create collections (Locks), mint NFTs (keys)  on top of Unlock Protocol.\nPolygon\nAs part of the tools which will be built to enable management of these workshops we will be building an open sourced MATIC native art workshop platform (dApp) that will allow users to deploy smart contracts on the Polygon network and mint NFTs from those contracts. \nWeb3Social\nAs part of the tools which will be built to enable the management of these workshops we will be building an open sourced completely web3 native art workshop platform.

This has led to the formation of sub-DAOs and guilds. However, most of the current tooling to manage grants, bounties and tasks, distribute rewards and make decisions are built for monolithic DAOs instead of modular ones. Moreover, these tools are point solution which means each tool serves a specific purpose. Therefore, with every addition of a new tool for a new use case, there is a loss of context among contributors.\n\n**About Spect**\n\nAt Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to form circles (or sub-DAOs) that manage grants, bounties and tasks. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build history of contributions with soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials.\n\n**What can Spect be used for today?**\n\n1. Forming organizations that can scale N levels deep\n2. Run Ecosystem Grants Program\n3. Run Onboarding Program\n4. Run Surveys\n5. Manage Tasks and Contacts as a community\n\nHere are docs on how these can be implemented in an organization -\nhttps://docs.spect.network/\n\n**Features**\n\n1. Fully customizable tables, kanbans, lists and gantts which can be used to setup workflows\n3. Web3 enabled, sybil protected forms with ability to analyze and export responses\n3. Extensive Automations to automate chores\n4. Credentialing using soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials\n5. Payment on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and Avalanche with any token using personal wallets or gnosis multi-sigs.\n\n**Integrations**\n\n1. Discord to map roles and automatically assign roles, send messages and create channels using automations.\n2. Guild.xyz to map roles and give granular permissions\n3. Gitcoin Passport for creating sybil protected forms\n4. Mintkudos to distribute soulbound tokens to contributors\n5. Snapshot to run voting periods on form responses and other data\n\n**What is upcoming?**\n\n1. Templated Use cases - Organizations will be able to setup advanced workflows within seconds with templates\n2. Complete Composability - Spect will be made composable on various different levels. Both developers and non-developers will be able to build their own applications with Spect. We already have an early version of our API docs that developers can use. In the near future, tables, lists, boards and forms will be made embeddable such that non-developers can build their own experiences using these.\n3. Make it possible for anyone to build custom widgets and bots on Spect.\n\n**How we will use the funding?**\n\nThe funding will be used to pay for infrastructure costs and contributor salaries.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1.

He got hooked during the first public round of Dark Forest and has been building in the ZK application ecosystem ever since.  Some of his work includes:\n\n** ZK Tooling and hardhat-circom **\n\nIn collaboration with Jacob Rosenthal, Blaine helped to rewrite Dark Forest's zkSNARK build processes. This work was generalized into the hardhat-circom plugin, a configurable hardhat plugin which provides developers with a set of ZK circuit build tasks, and provides TypeScript declarations for snarkjs.\n\n** Contributions to circom & snarkjs **\n\nBlaine contributes to circom and snarkjs on a regular basis. He\u2019s provided patches to reduce the bundle build by 50% and enabled WebWorker support.\n\n** Hardhat plugins **\n\nBlaine created and maintains a series of hardhat plugins, such as hardhat-diamond-abi and hardhat-settings, which make large-scale projects easier to manage. All of these plugins were made possible through funding raised on Gitcoin and will continue to be maintained as long as they are useful to people!\n\n** Project Sophon **\n\nAs one half of Project Sophon, Blaine open sources many experiments related to Dark Forest or other ZK ecosystem projects, such as darkforest-local, Broadcast market, and DF plugin-dev-server.\n\nGitcoin contributions will support Blaine's ongoing open-source work on ZK infrastructure, crypto-native gaming, and developer tools.", "website": "https://github.com/phated", "logoImg": "bafybeieqe5enwqcudxekje4auxvxk5oauxfu24cc2s6td3ywudh4ewto6u", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreicm3r3wu2f4pl7qpxnskn74rj4rfht7qgjaznn6rkgqejoafedtly"}, "userGithub": "https://github.com/phated", "projectGithub": "https://github.com/projectsophon", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "C4jdQzH9MZo/U/ovMdQCc5u0O0RHK+0lLH0j0c5//RKFZfRo7hkGjix7skjpITuj", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "e767483296bc60cd29dc20a5d4e5636731e2cd1616004f9ae3b94b5ec26bc0659b400f9fb029fc899543226c4c679212df323dd571e26193b060d50d1391e3e10fe9eb41801f139b8de3ec26218dc61ae016e965518b52d9d0514cdebf081aa680006230f00920c6d7812439118e0a002a7234c863bd5d6f2639497789e3370d0000000000000020b2865635d56637e201154f2a6acda188210147d29f4a52e52b6dcab4766edc1fcfd2656d83e1e3b8375dd60ef8e81db9"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Gitcoin, 0xPARC Grants, GitHub Sponsors"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "1"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "GitHub"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/phated & https//github.com/projectsophon"}]}}}, {"id": "0xbb32c228edfe6261e885bca6e9fde72472ea1dce414a49b008148aabfa7fd427-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0xbb32c228edfe6261e885bca6e9fde72472ea1dce414a49b008148aabfa7fd427", "status": "REJECTED", "payoutAddress": "0x715aCC4a912f979279b9B3d3a46A3cF1e006C033", "createdAt": "1673511743", "updatedAt": "1673511743", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreihqq6fg6e4uefdpggybijefs7c6wpu4p2bmg42coq2azji26lrq6i"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x886cf60e3cedd0f188cac7eda43e1a75da34f89f4fba64ce23365fee4a740ea41f1ed44470ea79d8a58c19dbf618c3b8eed7750052a784da4ef1c8de707b8d201c", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x715aCC4a912f979279b9B3d3a46A3cF1e006C033", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673511480607, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:154", "title": "Contracts bots gang", "description": "A collection of Forta detection bots to automatically analyze, inspect, and detect bugs on newly deployed contracts.

Unlike other systems that rely on money-based governance, Idena operates on the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" ensuring that power is distributed equally among all participants. This prevents a small group from gaining too much control. \n\nIdena offers a puppet-resistant crypto-identity primitive, which is used for democratic voting, Quadratic Funding, fair airdrops and decentralized governance.\n\nIdena is accessible to anyone. It does not require any personal information and allows participants to join the network without any investments. Users play an active role in mutual verification by challenging each other with AI-resistant FLIP-tests. This process is done in a synchronous ceremony, which ensures that individuals cannot spoof multiple accounts.\n\nThe network is protected from Sybil attacks through regular validations and Quadratic Staking.

live. You can try Spect here.\nhttps://circles.spect.network/\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nIt is hard to operate a DAO successfully without the right processes & tools in place. For example, \n1. A grant program could lead to a high number of churn among grantees if grantees are not supported well or are not provided with enough companionship to help them succeed. \n2. Onboarding new members to a DAO may lead to a cultural & experiential decay for existing members if the right members are not onboarded and if new members are not educated about the culture & processes within the DAO. \n3. It is hard to have a shared sense of context among contributors if context is spread across various platforms and resources. \n4. Incentivized surveys, more often than not, attract sybil attackers looking to make a quick buck and in the process destroying the integrity of the survey.\n\nSpect exists to solve such problems & in the process help DAOs succeed.\n\n\n**About Spect**\n\nAt Spect, our goal is to centralize context while at the same time decentralize decision making. To do this, we have built a tool for DAOs to manage grants, onboarding and projects all on Spect and make decisions about grant applications & who to onboard in a decentralized way. A tool that can also be used by contributors to fund each other and build history of contributions with soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials.\n\n\n**What can Spect be used for today?**\n\n1. Ecosystem Grants Program\n2. Onboarding Program\n3. Surveys\n4. Task and Contact management\n5. Forming workstreams that help in scaling an organization\n\nHere are docs on how these can be implemented in an organization -\nhttps://docs.spect.network/\n\n\n**Features**\n\n1. Fully customizable tables, kanbans, lists and gantts which can be used to setup workflows\n3. Web3 enabled, sybil protected forms with ability to analyze and export responses\n3. Extensive Automations to automate recurring chores\n4. Credentialing using soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials\n5. Payment on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain and Avalanche with any token using personal wallets or gnosis multi-sigs.\n6. Templates that help you get started with an advanced workflow in seconds.\n\n\n**Integrations**\n\n1. Discord to map roles and automatically assign roles, send messages and create channels using automations.\n2. Guild.xyz to map roles and give granular permissions\n3. Gitcoin Passport for creating sybil protected forms\n4. Mintkudos to distribute soulbound tokens to contributors\n5. Snapshot to run voting periods on form responses and other data\n6. Gnosis Safe to distribute payments from multi-sig\n\n\n**What is upcoming?**\n\n1. Complete Composability - Spect will be made composable on various different levels. Both developers and non-developers will be able to build their own applications with Spect. We already have an early version of our API docs that developers can use. In the near future, tables, lists, boards and forms will be made embeddable such that non-developers can build their own experiences using these.\n2. Make it possible for anyone to build custom widgets and bots on Spect.\n\n\n**How we will use the funding?**\n\nThe funding will be used to pay for infrastructure costs and contributor salaries. \n\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. Fill up the early adopter form and claim a soulbound token.\nhttps://circles.spect.network/r/074c06d9-120f-4b99-87a9-c0f6e415c9a3\n\n2. Create your organization on Spect.\nhttps://circles.spect.network/\n\n3. Follow us on Twitter.\nhttps://twitter.com/JoinSpect\n\n4. Come say gm on Discord.\nhttps://discord.gg/AF2qRMMpZ9\n\n5.

BanklessDAO launched on May 4, 2021, and its goal is to drive adoption and awareness of truly bankless money systems like Ethereum, DeFi, and Bitcoin.\nTogether, the BanklessDAO community collaborates to create user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralised financial technologies through education, media and culture.\nThe BanklessDAO community runs a variety of projects; for the scope of this grant we are focusing on the ones which truly provide goods and services for the entire world such as BANKLESS ACADEMY, BANKLESS AFRICA, and INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES. \nThe projects listed below have had contributors working on them for many months and although some of the project contributors earn governance tokens, the work being done far outstrips the existing remuneration. Second, and perhaps more important, is that all these projects aim to help the wider crypto ecosystem and not just the Bankless community \u2014 and hence are public goods.\nBANKLESS ACADEMY\n\ud83d\ude80 Brief\nBankless Academy is a leading web3 \"knowledge on-ramp\" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.\nWe're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to go Bankless.\n\ud83d\udd25 Vision\nWe are building a web3 world where:\n\ud83d\udcda Information is frictionless and free.\n\ud83d\udc4a Communities are high impact creators.\n\ud83c\udf10 Education is permissionless (no central body dictates what you can/can't see).\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Trajectory\nCurrent focuses:\nEstablish a Bankless-native syllabus/user journey to move users from Centralised Exchanges to Ethereum Layer2 self-custody.\nPursue collaboration with popular dApps to educate users on trusted tools available to them.\nBuild theory lessons with expert guests from the Bankless 'Hall of Fame'.\nForm frontier partnerships so that the Academy dApp continues to support interoperability and cutting-edge use cases.\nContinue research, development, and onboarding for our whitelabel platform to scale our efforts into other web3 ecosystems.\nBuild a framework for contributor content creation to empower talented community educators.\n\ud83d\udcc0 Try the dApp:\nhttps://app.banklessacademy.com/\nMultiple wallets supported\nMobile friendly\nNo download\nhttps://giveth.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPkVpSqhUr1bUALLHL2ErzytqM5wHh2RmkCF82GApe8Lv\n\ud83c\udf0f Let's scale permissionless education together!\nBANKLESS AFRICA\nOur community is focused on promoting the bDAO mission. We leverage crypto-based creations like Bitcoin, Defi, NFTs etc. to tackle problems faced by Africans.\nAchievement/Growth:\n*Our podcast highlights projects and people making impact in the African crypto/Web3 ecosystem.\n*Our Newsletter provides well curated information on Bitcoin, DeFi, crypto regulations, projects and Web3 funding in the crypto/Web3 space in Africa.\n*Our website helps Africans access educational courses. It includes a link to Bankless Academy where lots of Web3 courses are available. Eventually this website will become a native-educational platform for Africans.\nWebsite v1 here: https://banklessafrica.com/\n*We onboard and train contributors with various Web3 ethos, teaching them how to contribute in various DAOs and potentially bootstrap project ideas they have.\nSome links to get into our community: https://linktr.ee/banklessafrica.\n\ud83c\udf0f INTERNATIONAL MEDIA NODES (IMN)\nOnly 5% of the world\u2019s population are native English speakers and roughly 15% speak English on some level. The initial goal of the IMN project is to reach the remaining 80% by translating and distributing content about blockchain technology, DeFi, the Metaverse and Web3. All links: https://www.banklessimn.xyz/\nThe International Media Nodes project believes in the liberating effect of going Bankless and what it can do for improving financial wellbeing and stability throughout the world. Creating and maintaining communities of people who do not speak English and educating them/opening the door for them to onboard to Web3 is one of the most crucial pieces of infrastructure if we want Web3 to be any different from Web2.\nThe story so far\u2026\nIn Q1 2022, the total audience grew by 52% as compared to the previous quarter and our total reach is over 40,000 audience members in over 20 languages. We have more than 100 active contributors speaking 20 different languages from all parts of the world. We have worked with prominent DAOs in Web3 such as Polygon, Tribe and Yearn.\nOver the next months and years, as we continue to produce content we will also start developing local language communities which will develop Web3 talent in local languages as well as organising events in different geographical locations to onboard more people.\n\nOur Ask to the Crypto Community ...\nAt the highest level, the Web3 education provided by BanklessDAO stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.\nWe seriously can\u2019t wait to show you what we have to offer this space.\nLet\u2019s Impact Together!\nBanklessDAO believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world, both in learning and translation. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone.\nLet\u2019s help the world go Bankless!", "website": "https://www.bankless.community/", "bannerImg": "bafybeigxjivwgcz4njxfdky5yw7kzysfghusf6j72srucr3adn4msgryde", "logoImg": "bafkreifhgemr6res2dsvkqy26vc4eveaf2g6qmjdqg3rnjal6cy4lmorwq", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreibmdnyarqimo5v32o5phq7haoop4u5lc2zo3lan4nbh6di4caaoga"}, "userGithub": "https://github.com/BanklessDAO", "projectTwitter": "https://twitter.com/banklessDAO", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "2DbNmI3QQKSWAnSb/QXkQXoTQUDijdfNZUvvgDqL4BcXxNjTTtGd9qjXW0W9vkgl", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "ad9876029f108238d87bc45d4282faf9cc740aa01dd7dbde4d605668563dea5c162c80b043cd171889ca0624ae6d6403ea7e9363f56459c040efc24dbd74259b39e16bf34a3e9453f54f40ecfdf534233c407696a5a6dc39db57c7a7d3efa5b9756f1c2a4c208bfa396441ba31192148b5cc0ef126fed64e584edaf49d834a560000000000000020efd610a6bd2e8fddbc774fdeae2cea72b6c03be199e769fca4bfa4ff3e680ddefffd2d9385339fb9e2d3e254359c5188"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "token"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "Variable - DAO"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "No because different people in the DAO own different responsibilities.

This leads to bridging the economic gap by enabling people to monetize their digital footprint on a secure and fair decentralized application. Currently, traditional apps often harvest user data and sell it to other companies without the user's knowledge or consent, and users receive no compensation for their data. This has led to the rise of large corporations that hold a monopoly on data and influence our daily lives. At the same time, researchers and small and medium-sized companies struggle to obtain data to build predictive models for various purposes, such as finding jobs, providing healthcare, and educating children.\n\nSince the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, internet users have the right to access their personal data on each platform. However, many people are unaware of this right and the value of their data. Datalatte aims to address this issue by leveraging decentralized technologies such as cryptocurrency, decentralized applications, and exchanges to empower people to gain control over their data and its use.\n\nTo achieve data democracy, Datalatte plans to store tokenized data in users' wallets using protocols like IPFS and Filecoin for decentralized storage and Ocean protocol's Data NFTs for compliant and self-sovereign data licensing and monetization. However, the current table-structured data model is not easily understandable and requires significant resources to extract insights. Datalatte aims to address this issue by using a graph-structured data model based on small Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which allow for easy access and utilization of data through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and offer higher computational efficiency through privacy-preserving data pipelines.\n\nThe goals of Datalatte include empowering internet users to monetize their data, providing data scientists with access to affordable data, enabling full control and ownership of personal data for internet users, and creating a data-backed income through personal data monetization. To achieve these objectives, Datalatte will develop a decentralized data store that allows users to sell their data rather than having it sold by large corporations.\n\nOverall, Datalatte aims to create a more equitable and transparent system for data monetization by empowering individuals and providing researchers and small businesses with access to valuable data.", "website": "https://datalatte.com", "bannerImg": "bafybeidwuri3nzqcow3cy36cy4o6oj4oqd7fghqsuizgzycivwwpzvxmfi", "logoImg": "bafkreigbqulls7vuoxiyz2u2nrqm35jvw6mwldza5dnx7xezevrjqmyydu", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreiaosvcrva4s6y4edtjklvr7br7i75tygnm7s4vtbw6eyv72gjqlrq"}, "userGithub": "amirmabhout", "projectGithub": "datalatte-ai", "projectTwitter": "datalatte_", "credentials": {"twitter": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB17b3e7910AF9d232Cb683C083eF73c34521FC8A", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}], "provider": "ClearTextTwitter#datalatte_", "hash": "v0.0.0:K5wGghLGGGM1HvJ0Bkl3T4N257tWWSmJB3ZKmXkvpLQ="}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-13T08:12:03.464Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-13T08:12:03.464Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..RcmgaeRXxFyOzVa9PY-MtaD-0reZbY4EIWWuXJdG-k_ucfjw0co6XZnwkqH_uEDE5xjvgBlIIRu7STgx2gI3AA"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-13T08:12:03.464Z"}, "github": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xB17b3e7910AF9d232Cb683C083eF73c34521FC8A", "provider": "ClearTextGithubOrg#datalatte-ai#90555973", "hash": "v0.0.0:8/ii1lQxgy9/Dlk8MqHNNzoGhu6HeAvgA8HmTZso8+k=", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}]}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-13T08:12:23.363Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-13T08:12:23.363Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..OSMGFbNhNi6UCqZ4SivdympiVkNE26d90mMe8rNwuXdK7c_LtBUU84OdAP8uBAGvvpZwUQMlE1e5K83iNtMlCw"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-13T08:12:23.363Z"}}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "C4aXP9JSem7kq+MfHs+dnZh4Sn5Cb/9UdMEol74Jxz2U/nxMI1MoCYEcl8F1tmig", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "6ccf81a533afff4b9e4f50c183834350dae5b117fe180a214ced356ac5af2653f71d515079b8277dc4f9a90d30b0db1418032b5d3e3f1f7309c2c58068f693eed5c7d0efe8b4da03147e6dd1f70e287def26761c4d164e8cf8788b940ddbcca5a70a329199bce53601c3b1cd317b8905c88136e18c809c3818ea1d076c7b67b200000000000000207146341a51357b29e0342c978f8baf3356e28744d0fefb72cbaef989ab4143ce3a5a4b3d789112fcb3adb0caa86140a0"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "OceanDAO & Gitcoin Gtants"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "8"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/datalatte-ai   https://github.com/amirmabhout"}]}}}, {"id": "0xe1ae0696ac9550ffde401be8421f3ed3fc89d8c2a672797263be1d32dfe5eb43-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0xe1ae0696ac9550ffde401be8421f3ed3fc89d8c2a672797263be1d32dfe5eb43", "status": "APPROVED", "payoutAddress": "0x640C28441f9e73537C63576A0D6f44643a577E32", "createdAt": "1673557271", "updatedAt": "1673557271", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreiheznianivyjea54rcy5nj3pghitaprvnfrwhdn3m5mqwy5ao5d2m"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0x91a8bc269a8f3a34ca4dcf1ea8c743d0039c6fe08ef8ce1477ff4420fba96d4d06db35307b65c7da908340d26e0d71a203d8a7167d2618ca4be6067a5161b6491b", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x640C28441f9e73537C63576A0D6f44643a577E32", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673554483626, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:169", "title": "Electronic Frontier Foundation", "description": "For over 30 years, EFF has been the leading nonprofit advocate for the privacy and free speech rights of technology creators and ordinary users. Our team achieves success through impact litigation, policy analysis and education, grassroots activism, technology development, and support from the public. EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.\n\nCOMMUNITY ADVOCACY\n\nFrom the early days of the web, EFF understood that we must protect access to technology in order to advance freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used its fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies. EFF\u2019s work in the growing movement for web decentralization and the public interest internet is no different.\n\nIn order to combat the ever-consolidating power of corporate giants (and end the gatekeeping, surveillance, and censorship that often accompany them), many have looked toward blockchain-based technology and cryptocurrency for remedies. EFF is optimistic about the ability of digital currency to support independent community projects, route around financial censorship, and support independent journalists around the world.\n\nWhile there are still many problems to solve in the blockchain ecosystem, the world needs thoughtful, user-focused advocates like EFF to help uncover the opportunities for public good. This is why EFF fought a poorly-defined cryptocurrency provision in the Biden Administration\u2019s infrastructure bill that could create onerous requirements affecting user privacy, and EFF also introduced bright-line rules that Congress should adopt when developing cryptocurrency regulations; we\u2019ve written extensively about the ways financial intermediaries censor legal speech; we submitted comments to FinCEN opposing the agency\u2019s proposal for new privacy-invasive regulations of cryptocurrency transactions; and we\u2019ve called for blockchain intermediaries to issue transparency reports and protect the rights of their users. During the Tornado Cash controversy, EFF spoke out for the speech protections on software code and represented Johns Hopkins Professor Matthew Green, who made a fork of the code and posted the replica so it would be available for study. EFF also reached out to The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to seek more clarity on their interpretation of the sanctions listing. \n\nOPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS\n\nWhile EFF is proud to be a leading voice in online rights debates, we also develop gratis and open source tools to enhance everyone\u2019s freedom online. Your donations provide critical  support for EFF\u2019s wide-ranging work, which includes projects such as:\n\n- Atlas of Surveillance: This project launched in collaboration with hundreds of EFF members and university students. With over 10,000 data points and counting, the Atlas is the largest searchable database of U.S. law enforcement\u2019s surveillance technologies.\n\n- Certbot: This software tool allows you to automatically deploy Let's Encrypt certificates to enable HTTPS on your website. EFF even helped develop Let\u2019s Encrypt which has in turn enabled free and easy encryption across the web!\n\n- Cover Your Tracks: This successor to EFF\u2019s Panopticlick demonstrates how well your browser and add-ons protect you from tracking and fingerprinting.\n\n- HTTPS Everywhere: This tool automatically connects users to the encrypted version of many major sites. Just over a decade after its launch, EFF declared success and announced the planned deprecation of our HTTPS Everywhere plugin because the functionality had been incorporated into all of the major web browsers, making it unnecessary.\n\n- Privacy Badger: With millions of active installs, this browser add-on was the first to specifically focus on blocking tracking in advertisements, instead of just the ads themselves. EFF\u2019s open-source technology has also inspired other widely used privacy tools, including the Brave browser and Safari\u2019s tracker blocking.\n\nThe world relies on the internet to stay connected and informed more than ever before, and that gives you a pivotal opportunity to stand up for technology users everywhere. Your support for EFF ensures that we always have a vocal advocate wherever tech and civil liberties meet.", "website": "https://eff.org", "bannerImg": "bafkreie5wkhybbs5oomyaq4aufqcoeo76lbv3jhokmy4tcb3pzdfpvxa7q", "logoImg": "bafkreicnljmaur4op2irvuflb3utpt62qivsjumfy3mm6nky6wrankruna", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreih3oabewrss4mdyb2tfdq6qivgdsthu2yqztnybd2c2wb5f2sqcb4"}, "projectTwitter": "eff", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "isinceR+YZoKC/tkIdXoyLL2VGnrgAgziX4JDtP9E2NkLp2p1+GOH+afTP1nUsTO", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "127f4d103190f050030bb905498eb67e906f8a69dcd5fe65a60f1e103a60a292ce35a09e8bfb554699478f8b149d5b18007a5d8416731ccc7b6be9f009cb69f702048e416861c288f947add643533acf44497e10974fd5e00eb53a6c894bb5a675954ec78210f40c5af1411ac7c02f3ae1b1af5a663969f227fdde355e941feb00000000000000208c930ffe3f5171d991187d0d704a571aa4f8c796f998c9b7662010af48f6d971f9473542da0159b1c5736dc882bdc5af"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Public donations and grants."}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "94"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/EFForg"}]}}}, {"id": "0xe2f4ea6f46ef9d67818f71b8c40403b8528768af11f7fe0c2d10cd2afe21de62-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0xe2f4ea6f46ef9d67818f71b8c40403b8528768af11f7fe0c2d10cd2afe21de62", "status": "APPROVED", "payoutAddress": "0xdE81d67Af572EC0F22841da702C1EdC25608dBBB", "createdAt": "1673038079", "updatedAt": "1673038079", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreifoxbpo3g6t4tbtx4h34mcrxo3b7m5i7n4hv4ybc6npnzk6ttvt64"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0xd5cb8b088693e98c7a1b27ce0da47b9157e0c255960b14b5744b23950c54d239102f83dec045d0416d8cfe7fb6c5856bd03303681e9380fb736f8c067c821be11c", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0xdE81d67Af572EC0F22841da702C1EdC25608dBBB", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673036680083, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:43", "title": "Nimi.eth", "description": "Nimi allows users to effortlessly host on their ENS domain, making web3 websites easy.

To achieve this, we needed to elaborate cultural designs that reinforce commoning principles and create novel tools such as the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), Conviction Voting (CV) and the Praise reward and reputation system. \n\nOur Commons design patterns are made up of a suite of cultural frameworks and a curated library of tools for governance, funding, proposal, analytics and initialization of a Commons. Some have come straight out of our research collaborations -  such as the ABC, CV and Praise. We also use Collaborative Economics, a methodology for enabling the community to collectively propose iterate and finalize the parameters of their Commons\u2019 economy.\n\nWe see the work of Elinor Ostrom as our North Star and set out to weave her principles of governing commons into the cultural fabric of a Commons. Our Cultural Build defines practices for clear boundaries, conflict resolution, monitoring, participatory decision-making, and others principles. \n\nOther things we have done are supporting BlockScience in open-sourcing cadCAD, developing the edutainment program Commons Simulator, launching the Trusted Seed, developing a collaborative economics method, deploying the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) - the first field test for our Commons design patterns, launching the Commons Prize and doing a discovery of the needs of Grassroots Economics, the winner of the prize.\n\nWhile we have already had some success, we have only just begun. Our research continues. The lessons learned from a first field test, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our curated commons library of tools and processes continues to evolve. \n\nWe did not get this far alone. We have collaborated with BlockScience, Blossom Labs, Metagov, Curve Labs, PrimeDAO, Giveth, 1Hive, Aragon, Token Engineering Academy, Token Engineering Commons, and many others.\n\nMuch of our Github activity (https://github.com/commons-stack) is collaborative. We work hand in hand with General Magic, Token Engineering Commons and Praise, specifically:\nhttps://github.com/givepraise/\nhttps://github.com/commonsbuild\nhttps://github.com/GeneralMagicio/\n\n\nPLANS FOR ALPHA ROUND FUNDING\n\nFor this round, we will focus on one deliverable - donations to this grant will contribute to the costs of open-sourcing our Commons deployment protocols. Our intention in doing so is to allow any community to deploy its own commons-inspired economy, i.e, the intentionally ground-up launch of an economy to support a purpose or public good.\n\nWe are in process of building the guidelines for initializing and deploying a Commons. Funding will enable our team to continue our work on the open-source documentation of our deployment protocols that will help Commons facilitate the communal management of public goods through a regenerative economic system. \n\nThe documentation covers the four phases of the Commons deployment: Engage, Incubate, Hatch and Launch. In every phase, we outline the processes, tools and different concepts that will bring about the creation of a sustainable and scalable Commons.\n\n \nUPDATES SINCE GR15\n \nDonations from the Gitcoin GR15 helped our team accomplish the following in the last quarter:\n \n- We worked with our pilot Commons to grant over $400,000 to various Token Engineering initiatives, via the economic system we collectively designed.\n\n- The Token Engineering Commons has proved out the value of the Augmented Bonding Curve and Trusted Seed approach, as participating in the Hatch has been one of the better investments in crypto (beating the price of ETH by over 2x)\n\n- Co-developed Praise and spun it out to be its own independent project, focused on becoming a reputation system and rewards distribution tool. We open-sourced the deployment and supported several communities in using it.\n\n - Worked on-the-ground in Kenya with Grassroots Economics to understand the needs for their complex economic model and jointly explore possible solutions.\n\n- Initiated the \u201cLaunch a Commons\u201d campaign to engage purpose-driven web3 communities in becoming tokenized communities that will create and steward public goods.\n\nThank you for your generosity! \ud83d\ude4f", "website": "https://commonsstack.org/", "bannerImg": "bafkreick5f3lez5vbbnwevsk3wgdp5fg4n6z4ts5uz7iyaafriy5jwgtfe", "logoImg": "bafkreiajbf7swocekdtnevjir67videhgxjtjk3vnwumubazvdejli7h5a", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreidmmmcadruklypnxgymioizky7hngcebwwm4yhxh5xsejglfxjtou"}, "userGithub": "", "projectGithub": "", "projectTwitter": "commonsstack", "credentials": {"twitter": {"@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], "type": ["VerifiableCredential"], "credentialSubject": {"id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xC5A756D63C5fe67b438acBE468aA62a52093fDEf", "hash": "v0.0.0:OEaixMWgiQIGJn8KM8LxY56CsQJUJTr717abSJCuerE=", "provider": "ClearTextTwitter#commonsstack", "@context": [{"hash": "https://schema.org/Text", "provider": "https://schema.org/Text"}]}, "issuer": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "issuanceDate": "2023-01-16T00:57:18.019Z", "proof": {"type": "Ed25519Signature2018", "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod", "verificationMethod": "did:key:z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC#z6MkghvGHLobLEdj1bgRLhS4LPGJAvbMA1tn2zcRyqmYU5LC", "created": "2023-01-16T00:57:18.019Z", "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il0sImI2NCI6ZmFsc2V9..QzY0sTtu_taxc0WVsFUFvEayB50d7wav2Anr2u6_raC0dQMhENb9TSSW5Mfu8hpO_-rznWcwECOV5F6px1ExDg"}, "expirationDate": "2023-04-16T00:57:18.019Z"}}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "zm2uOXxwT48GsgJa/GJuvXfrDlxJHz5fKv0agEj33tF/YUpEL2dMQ6PDVR6WmcMl", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "c514c81d7da0970daca5da903fdc0d4e29bb0ec42f14863ca42dae76aca9ddf04c87c1f48af1fe3c3902056c7cca0104aa2ab59af35b9b978c7854b7c83741c45c09af12982c2bc3ec6110714c08fd8f5f4efa2b80861a0ff8580de4bf08a0a18d82c94e524a21829c2f53398ee08af1f7ce5039d386cffe57534d8d4c5c260600000000000000207cd9796665f6750baf0cb97bfde135cc8ba4a3c33017a55f7073df1184359b9c388177a46e2fe833c7c26b25024d43a9"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "Donations on Giveth and Gitcoin"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "7"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "Yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/iviangita, https://github.com/commons-stack"}]}}}, {"id": "0xe797fdf65ab6db40d29cb7144e8715799a91c9a2f8a7dffc6697750089f07dbf-0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "project": "0xe797fdf65ab6db40d29cb7144e8715799a91c9a2f8a7dffc6697750089f07dbf", "status": "APPROVED", "payoutAddress": "0x1208a26FAa0F4AC65B42098419EB4dAA5e580AC6", "createdAt": "1673354867", "updatedAt": "1673354867", "metaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreidwl3sp6jlf56ne6gaypw3qglk7dlf6cxzgvwqpsllmvnu7jmgble"}, "ipfs": {"signature": "0xa18d6b7158670c16d9b5f58c958cd3cd5365d9e16c9fb9c52c932312bf33f06733c4d3fa4cdc2f1fe80d114b0387e6ce34cc2b2c021f6b6454f1cb9e5263af5b1b", "application": {"round": "0xd95a1969c41112cee9a2c931e849bcef36a16f4c", "recipient": "0x1208a26FAa0F4AC65B42098419EB4dAA5e580AC6", "project": {"lastUpdated": 0, "createdAt": 1673354257691, "id": "1:0x03506eD3f57892C85DB20C36846e9c808aFe9ef4:98", "title": "MintBot | Polygon NFT Minter + ENS SubDomains (no gas)", "description": "Mintbot started out as a service that allows ENS Domain holders to create collections for free and mint NFTs directly from their Telegram account.\n\nThe NFTs are minted on Polygon (an Ethereum layer 2 network) and the bot covers the gas costs.\n\nOn successful minting, your NFTs are visible and tradeable on marketplaces (which support Polygon) such as Opensea.

Allowances are an important part of using these apps, but can be dangerous if left unchecked.\n\nBugs can exists and exploits can happen even in established projects, and by approving token allowances you are potentially exposing your wallet to these exploits. To keep yourself safe from allowance exploits it is a good practice to regularly inspect and revoke your allowances.\n\nRevoke.cash comes in as a preventative tool to manage your token allowances and practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active allowances you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of allowance exploits.\n\nIn many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an allowance while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases.

funding projects, ideas and public goods in web3. GiveStation is decentralized which means anyone can create a grant anytime and get grants approved by a consensus vote from the contributiors.\n\nProblem?\n\nThe main driving factor for the success of crowdfunding was the ability to raise funds by just making some short description of what you want to raise funds for and then submit it on platforms like Kickstarter, GoFundme, etc.\n\nHowever, later it turned out that this model was polluted and centralized crowdfunding platform does little or no background checks and follow-up on the projects.\n\nThe crowdfunding community is too centralized and while the Contributors are being screwed for donating and trusting a project/idea, they end up not seeing the impact of their contributions.\n\nThere is almost no room from transparency by default. This a huge challenge for every of the traditional crowdfunding ecosystem, and that is what we are here to fix.\n\nLesson learned:\n\nWe have learnt that web3 is the tool needed to solve this problem once an for all.\n\nContributors should be empowered by recurring incentives for the value they create according to the level of impact.\n\nContributors are the backbone of every crowdfunding system.\n\nSolution\n\nOur mission is reward and protect the contributors while making sure that the funds allocated to this founders and teams are used in the right way.\n\nIncentivization\n\nTo encourage Contributors to participate in funding projects and to also experience a better community while contributing to the GiveStation\u2019s ecosystem, we have put together a reward mechanism.\n\nTo paint a better scenario - At the end of each funding round, contributors will be able to claim GVST token as additional rewards.\n\nGovernance and Decentralization\n\nOn GiveStation, the community governing system which most of its missions and goals are largely influenced by votes and users are granted flexibility and control not otherwise seen with traditional crowdfunding models.\n\nIf Contributors matters a lot in the crowdfunding system then introducing a transparent way to raise fund is the best way to raise funds and this it will not only protect the Contributors, it also creates an atmosphere of trust where the Contributors know where his/her donations go to and how its being used.\n\nOverview Project Overview\n\nAfter the funding is completed. There will be no disbursement of funds if the grant does not get at least 50% approval vote from its donors.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe creators/team creates a project,\n\nThey hit their target from contributions.\n\nThey make funds withdrawal request.\n\nFunds get sent to their provided wallet after at least 50% of donors have approved the withdrawal request.\n\nFurthermore, our medium article here explains how we take care of KYC and compliance to prevent rogue grants creators/team from listing projects for the aim of defrauding the system.\n\nWe are currently on the Gitcoin grants round and the little we have raised so far along with our personal team funds has helped us build the project to the stage it is today and we plan and hope to raise more to introduce more features soon.\n\nThe goal is to incentivize the web3 ecosystem by integrating token rewards for users who contributes to projects on each of this blockchain protocols.\n\nProject links:\n\nDApp: app.givestation.org\n\nWebsite:Givestation.org\n\nTwitter: @givestation\n\nGithub: GiveStation Github.com/Givestation\n\nDiscord/Discourse/Community: Givestation Discord\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?\n\nUser incentivization - We believe ideas can get funding from VCs and all but user acquistion is whole different journey and while other dapps are focusing on exchange, defi, swap, etc Givestation is creating a platform where public goods can get funding with no middle man while rewarding the users which are the pillars and real reason these ideas come to live.\n\nOn the other hand, building a project can take a lot of time and the idea may end up on the shelf not because its not good enough, but funding in the industry seem to be tilting towards a certain part and that\u2019s why we are creating a p2p grant ecosystem where donors meets creators, create an impact by donating and also be in charge of how/when funds are released.\n\nWith this solution, we expect to see a major increase in number of developers and builders coming to build very good projects while contributors who will later turn to users will also stay to support as there is now an instant reward for them.\n\nWho can raise funds on GiveStation - GiveStation is accessible to everybody as long as you have a great idea. Regardless of your country, tribe, race, etc.\n\nProgress Our Dapp is on testnet on five blockchains inclusing Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Polygon and Binance.\n\nUsers can create and contribute to grants and claim Givepoints (GP) on their dashboard.\n\nWhile we were at this stage, we saw what bringing the protocol to other chain could mean for the crowdfunding ecosystem and what the subsequent version will look like including features like:\n\nSome new features like Hosting of hackathons for other projects will be introduced in the next update.\n\nDifferentiation The platform is not limited to developers and web programmers alone as we have made the platform available for everybody as long as they need funds to bring their ideas into reality.\n\nAny user can visit the platform, pick any idea or project they believe in, contribute directly to this life changing projects and in doing so, they get rewarded.\n\nThe requested funds will serve as a bridge to launch the new, ready-for-prime-time version of GiveStation. Expenses include:\n\nMarketing\n\nDesign and branding .\n\nGovernance, airdrop, staking, and/or liquidity\n\nCompensation to contributors.", "website": "https://app.givestation.org", "bannerImg": "bafybeia6cwqidhwhatmayngb6ur7iu3mxpqxiqpvo4pt4igc65ogwk5v6a", "logoImg": "bafybeibs5rioc5t6czic75oi4dj72ryx24zc6qsxjhjgewcyjom2wfbaxi", "metaPtr": {"protocol": "1", "pointer": "bafkreig7ihhdh6zuqczvepjcj4bigta3vmw3zi7yuhva2ekecfsb5njt5e"}, "userGithub": "givestation", "projectGithub": "https://github.com/MrBloomguy/givestaion-team-dapp", "credentials": {}}, "answers": [{"questionId": 0, "question": "Email Address", "encryptedAnswer": {"ciphertext": "XJD/add2YpKGwUimn3wtCFJ2Do0ecjTDQmLnyalG6Q0WZ3OwQ6T+Pems1GStTPa5", "encryptedSymmetricKey": "ab41da3ba1a2eb5ec592fd91015bfccfbb1c66cb52864d93b8a076e8f645bd15b92b119ce3567368e36a72cb75a40808074e0d61c8e17572df68452cdf0e2b1a949648a51e14c5b14559ad58ea93937a60356bb21dec426248cd9c4364dff28f6acfc3e1ad132629997e83a676a6ab3ed1c9953ef52fedbdeb671b6a61fbd4c70000000000000020568624fc526962e68f67866ee6550faf34997de292943ccf5f9f4b99d3881f956f211d77567b53aa7d78879adb2de08a"}}, {"questionId": 1, "question": "Funding Sources", "answer": "gitcoin grants"}, {"questionId": 2, "question": "Team Size", "answer": "4"}, {"questionId": 3, "question": "Have you verified your Github and or Twitter account on Grants Hub?", "answer": "yes"}, {"questionId": 4, "question": "Confirm and include links to your Github user account and organization account here", "answer": "https://github.com/MrBloomguy/givestaion-team-dapp"}]}}}], "roundMetaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreicidf6icuw44izwvmvmmm2om7zchyza7u4ferxky2awb2erbkud3a"}, "projectsMetaPtr": {"protocol": 1, "pointer": "bafkreib7spby4xlfp2bjefrpiqocqfrfpbhz3zinao6xrkv4tsqrkmlt34"}, "accounts": [{"address": "0x8073639b11994c549eda58fc3cd7132a72aadf10", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0xb8cef765721a6da910f14be93e7684e9a3714123", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x2df9a188fbe231b0dc36d14aceb65defbb049479", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0xb8cef765721a6da910f14be93e7684e9a3714123", "role": {"role": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}}, {"address": "0x9600e2ee6377dadad7299b120026661c336a5e6d", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x4873178bea2dcd7022f0ef6c70048b0e05bf9017", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x41105a64a7ae18bd6c31363ef5fd99dd574f7874", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x974bbc9c9b8a1b81e92df9d1457d2df98941814e", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0xc584f09928d490237831f6e5da805cba82652497", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x8f48282e50b0210bd7c7dd69c54205e98b9ef5d9", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0xf93f0b770784602fc3079eb1d2fb1ff488bb02b0", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}, {"address": "0x37e5e6eb36467f98392ebbb35f110fbb8238e6d3", "role": {"role": "0xec61da14b5abbac5c5fda6f1d57642a264ebd5d0674f35852829746dfb8174a5"}}], "votingStrategy": {"id": "0x746b951fa10a89d6cbe70d4ee23531f907b58bc0"}}
