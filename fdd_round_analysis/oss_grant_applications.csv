GiveStation is a multi-chain give-to-earn grant protocol that rewards users for funding projects, ideas and public goods in web3. GiveStation is decentralized which means anyone can create a grant anytime and get grants approved by a consensus vote from the contributiors.

Problem?

The main driving factor for the success of crowdfunding was the ability to raise funds by just making some short description of what you want to raise funds for and then submit it on platforms like Kickstarter, GoFundme, etc.

However, later it turned out that this model was polluted and centralized crowdfunding platform does little or no background checks and follow-up on the projects.

The crowdfunding community is too centralized and while the Contributors are being screwed for donating and trusting a project/idea, they end up not seeing the impact of their contributions.

There is almost no room from transparency by default. This a huge challenge for every of the traditional crowdfunding ecosystem, and that is what we are here to fix.

Lesson learned:

We have learnt that web3 is the tool needed to solve this problem once an for all.

Contributors should be empowered by recurring incentives for the value they create according to the level of impact.

Contributors are the backbone of every crowdfunding system.

Solution

Our mission is reward and protect the contributors while making sure that the funds allocated to this founders and teams are used in the right way.

Incentivization

To encourage Contributors to participate in funding projects and to also experience a better community while contributing to the GiveStation’s ecosystem, we have put together a reward mechanism.

To paint a better scenario - At the end of each funding round, contributors will be able to claim GVST token as additional rewards.

Governance and Decentralization

On GiveStation, the community governing system which most of its missions and goals are largely influenced by votes and users are granted flexibility and control not otherwise seen with traditional crowdfunding models.

If Contributors matters a lot in the crowdfunding system then introducing a transparent way to raise fund is the best way to raise funds and this it will not only protect the Contributors, it also creates an atmosphere of trust where the Contributors know where his/her donations go to and how its being used.

Overview Project Overview

After the funding is completed. There will be no disbursement of funds if the grant does not get at least 50% approval vote from its donors.

How it works:

The creators/team creates a project,

They hit their target from contributions.

They make funds withdrawal request.

Funds get sent to their provided wallet after at least 50% of donors have approved the withdrawal request.

Furthermore, our medium article here explains how we take care of KYC and compliance to prevent rogue grants creators/team from listing projects for the aim of defrauding the system.

We are currently on the Gitcoin grants round and the little we have raised so far along with our personal team funds has helped us build the project to the stage it is today and we plan and hope to raise more to introduce more features soon.

The goal is to incentivize the web3 ecosystem by integrating token rewards for users who contributes to projects on each of this blockchain protocols.

Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?

User incentivization - We believe ideas can get funding from VCs and all but user acquistion is whole different journey and while other dapps are focusing on exchange, defi, swap, etc Givestation is creating a platform where public goods can get funding with no middle man while rewarding the users which are the pillars and real reason these ideas come to live.

On the other hand, building a project can take a lot of time and the idea may end up on the shelf not because its not good enough, but funding in the industry seem to be tilting towards a certain part and that’s why we are creating a p2p grant ecosystem where donors meets creators, create an impact by donating and also be in charge of how/when funds are released.

With this solution, we expect to see a major increase in number of developers and builders coming to build very good projects while contributors who will later turn to users will also stay to support as there is now an instant reward for them.

Who can raise funds on GiveStation - GiveStation is accessible to everybody as long as you have a great idea. Regardless of your country, tribe, race, etc.

Progress Our Dapp is on testnet on five blockchains inclusing Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Polygon and Binance.

Users can create and contribute to grants and claim Givepoints (GP) on their dashboard.

While we were at this stage, we saw what bringing the protocol to other chain could mean for the crowdfunding ecosystem and what the subsequent version will look like including features like:

Some new features like Hosting of hackathons for other projects will be introduced in the next update.

Differentiation The platform is not limited to developers and web programmers alone as we have made the platform available for everybody as long as they need funds to bring their ideas into reality.

Any user can visit the platform, pick any idea or project they believe in, contribute directly to this life changing projects and in doing so, they get rewarded.

The requested funds will serve as a bridge to launch the new, ready-for-prime-time version of GiveStation. Expenses include:

Marketing

Design and branding .

Governance, airdrop, staking, and/or liquidity
