# streamlit_apps

# Reproducing the test app
To recreate this app on your own computer, you'll need conda and a compatible version of Python; the latest version of conda (23.1.0) and Python 3.9.12 are recommended, as later releases are not continuously supported.  These steps can be repeated and modified for different repos + apps with variable requirements, but be sure you're using compatible versions of both conda and python to avoid errors.


### Start by cloning the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/baokiddy/streamlit_apps.git
```
### We'll use this as our directory:
```
cd streamlit_apps
```
### If you need to update the repository in the future, you can do so by executing:
```
$ git pull
$ git checkout main
```
### Create conda environment
Create a conda environment called *firstapp* (or frankly, you can name it whatever you'd like because it's local. Go wild.)
```
conda create -n firstapp python=3.9.12
```
We'll use this virtual environment to run the app.
```
conda activate firstapp
```
### Install prerequisite libraries

Download requirements.txt file
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

###  Download and unzip contents from GitHub repo

Download and unzip contents from https://github.com/baokiddy/streamlit_apps/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

### Go into the directory of the test app you'd like to run. For our example, we'll use the fdd_round_analysis
```
cd fdd_round_analysis
```

###  Launch the app

```
streamlit run rounds_analysis.py
```
To get out of the app at any time, you'll use ^C to stop. You'll also want to deactivate conda, and then reactivate your conda environment again when you're ready (ours was called firstapp in this tutorial). Using these virtual environments is the safest way to be sure that your versioning and specs for streamlit purposes are not going to get mixed up with your home directory's settings--so don't forget that little step!

For any bugs or requests, please open a ticket on this repo. The more specific, the better!
